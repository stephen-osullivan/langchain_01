Him the Almighty Power\\nHurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie\\nWith hideous ruine and combustion down\\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell\\nIn Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,\\nWho durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.\\nNine times the Space that measures Day and Night\\nTo mortal men, he with his horrid crew\\nLay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe\\nConfounded though immortal: But his doom\\nReserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought\\nBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain\\nTorments him; round he throws his baleful eyes\\nThat witness’d huge affliction and dismay\\nMixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:\\nAt once as far as Angels kenn he views\\nThe dismal Situation waste and wilde,\\nA Dungeon horrible, on all sides round\\nAs one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames\\nNo light, but rather darkness visible\\nServ’d only to discover sights of woe,\\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes\\nThat comes to all; but torture without end\\nStill urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed\\nWith ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:\\nSuch place Eternal Justice had prepar’d\\nFor those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d\\nIn utter darkness, and their portion set\\nAs far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n\\nAs from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.\\nO how unlike the place from whence they fell!\\nThere the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d\\nWith Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,\\nHe soon discerns, and weltring by his side\\nOne next himself in power, and next in crime,\\nLong after known in _Palestine_, and nam’d\\n_Beelzebub_.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,\\nAnd thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words\\nBreaking the horrid silence thus began.\\n\\nIf thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d\\nFrom him, who in the happy Realms of Light\\nCloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine\\nMyriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,\\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope,\\nAnd hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,\\nJoynd with me once, now misery hath joynd\\nIn equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest\\nFrom what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd\\nHe with his Thunder: and till then who knew\\nThe force of those dire Arms? yet not for those\\nNor what the Potent Victor in his rage\\nCan else inflict do I repent or change,\\nThough chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind\\nAnd high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,\\nThat with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,\\nAnd to the fierce contention brought along\\nInnumerable force of Spirits arm’d\\nThat durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,\\nHis utmost power with adverse power oppos’d\\nIn dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,\\nAnd shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?\\nAll is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\\nThat Glory never shall his wrath or might\\nExtort from me.  To bow and sue for grace\\nWith suppliant knee, and deifie his power\\nWho from the terrour of this Arm so late\\nDoubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath\\nThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\\nAnd this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\\nSince through experience of this great event\\nIn Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,\\nWe may with more successful hope resolve\\nTo wage by force or guile eternal Warr\\nIrreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\\nWho now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy\\nSole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.\\n\\nSo spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,\\nVaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:\\nAnd him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.\\n\\nO Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\\nThat led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\\nUnder thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\\nFearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;\\nAnd put to proof his high Supremacy,\\nWhether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\\nToo well I see and rue the dire event,\\nThat with sad overthrow and foul defeat\\nHath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host\\nIn horrible destruction laid thus low,\\nAs far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences\\nCan Perish: for the mind and spirit remains\\nInvincible, and vigour soon returns,\\nThough all our Glory extinct, and happy state\\nHere swallow’d up in endless misery.\\nBut what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\\nOf force believe Almighty, since no less\\nThen such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)\\nHave left us this our spirit and strength intire\\nStrongly to suffer and support our pains,\\nThat we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\\nOr do him mightier service as his thralls\\nBy right of Warr, what e’re his business be\\nHere in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\\nOr do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\\nWhat can it then avail though yet we feel\\nStrength undiminisht, or eternal being\\nTo undergo eternal punishment?\\nWhereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.\\n\\nFall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable\\nDoing or Suffering: but of this be sure,\\nTo do ought good never will be our task,\\nBut ever to do ill our sole delight,\\nAs being the contrary to his high will\\nWhom we resist.  If then his Providence\\nOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,\\nOur labour must be to pervert that end,\\nAnd out of good still to find means of evil;\\nWhich oft times may succeed, so as perhaps\\nShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb\\nHis inmost counsels from their destind aim.\\nBut see the angry Victor hath recall’d\\nHis Ministers of vengeance and pursuit\\nBack to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail\\nShot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid\\nThe fiery Surge, that from the Precipice\\nOf Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,\\nWing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,\\nPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now\\nTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\\nLet us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,\\nOr satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\\nSeest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,\\nThe seat of desolation, voyd of light,\\nSave what the glimmering of these livid flames\\nCasts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend\\nFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,\\nThere rest, if any rest can harbour there,\\nAnd reassembling our afflicted Powers,\\nConsult how we may henceforth most offend\\nOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,\\nHow overcome this dire Calamity,\\nWhat reinforcement we may gain from Hope,\\nIf not what resolution from despare.\\n\\nThus Satan talking to his neerest Mate\\nWith Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\\nThat sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides\\nProne on the Flood, extended long and large\\nLay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\\nAs whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\\n_Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warr’d on _Jove_,\\n_Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den\\nBy ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast\\n_Leviathan_, which God of all his works\\nCreated hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:\\nHim haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam\\nThe Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,\\nDeeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,\\nWith fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\\nMoors by his side under the Lee, while Night\\nInvests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\\nSo stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\\nChain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence\\nHad ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will\\nAnd high permission of all-ruling Heaven\\nLeft him at large to his own dark designs,\\nThat with reiterated crimes he might\\nHeap on himself damnation, while he sought\\nEvil to others, and enrag’d might see\\nHow all his malice serv’d but to bring forth\\nInfinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\\nOn Man by him seduc’t, but on himself\\nTreble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.\\nForthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\\nHis mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\\nDrivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld\\nIn billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.\\nThen with expanded wings he stears his flight\\nAloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\\nThat felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\\nHe lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d\\nWith solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\\nAnd such appear’d in hue, as when the force\\nOf subterranean wind transports a Hill\\nTorn from _Pelorus_, or the shatter’d side\\nOf thundring _Aetna_, whose combustible\\nAnd fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,\\nSublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,\\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involv’d\\nWith stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\\nOf unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,\\nBoth glorying to have scap’t the _Stygian_ flood\\nAs Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,\\nNot by the sufferance of supernal Power.\\n\\nIs this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,\\nSaid then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat\\nThat we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom\\nFor that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee\\nWho now is Sovran can dispose and bid\\nWhat shall be right: fardest from him is best\\nWhom reason hath equald, force hath made supream\\nAbove his equals.  Farewel happy Fields\\nWhere Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail\\nInfernal world, and thou profoundest Hell\\nReceive thy new Possessor: One who brings\\nA mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.\\nThe mind is its own place, and in it self\\nCan make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.\\nWhat matter where, if I be still the same,\\nAnd what I should be, all but less then hee\\nWhom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least\\nWe shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built\\nHere for his envy, will not drive us hence:\\nHere we may reign secure, and in my choyce\\nTo reign is worth ambition though in Hell:\\nBetter to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.\\nBut wherefore let we then our faithful friends,\\nTh’ associates and copartners of our loss\\nLye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,\\nAnd call them not to share with us their part\\nIn this unhappy Mansion, or once more\\nWith rallied Arms to try what may be yet\\nRegaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?\\n\\nSo _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_\\nThus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,\\nWhich but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,\\nIf once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge\\nOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft\\nIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edge\\nOf battel when it rag’d, in all assaults\\nTheir surest signal, they will soon resume\\nNew courage and revive, though now they lye\\nGroveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,\\nAs we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,\\nNo wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.\\n\\nHe scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend\\nWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield\\nEthereal temper, massy, large and round,\\nBehind him cast; the broad circumference\\nHung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb\\nThrough Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views\\nAt Ev’ning from the top of _Fesole_,\\nOr in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands,\\nRivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.\\nHis Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine\\nHewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast\\nOf some great Ammiral, were but a wand,\\nHe walkt with to support uneasie steps\\nOver the burning Marle, not like those steps\\nOn Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime\\nSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;\\nNathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach\\nOf that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d\\nHis Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t\\nThick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks\\nIn _Vallombrosa_, where th’ _Etrurian_ shades\\nHigh overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge\\nAfloat, when with fierce Winds _Orion_ arm’d\\nHath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew\\n_Busiris_ and his _Memphian_ Chivalrie,\\nVVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d\\nThe Sojourners of _Goshen_, who beheld\\nFrom the safe shore their floating Carkases\\nAnd broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown\\nAbject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,\\nUnder amazement of their hideous change.\\nHe call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep\\nOf Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,\\nWarriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,\\nIf such astonishment as this can sieze\\nEternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place\\nAfter the toyl of Battel to repose\\nYour wearied vertue, for the ease you find\\nTo slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?\\nOr in this abject posture have ye sworn\\nTo adore the Conquerour? who now beholds\\nCherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood\\nWith scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon\\nHis swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern\\nTh’ advantage, and descending tread us down\\nThus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts\\nTransfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.\\nAwake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.\\n\\nThey heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\\nUpon the wing, as when men wont to watch\\nOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\\nRouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\\nNor did they not perceave the evil plight\\nIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\\nYet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\\nInnumerable.  As when the potent Rod\\nOf _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day\\nWav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud\\nOf _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind,\\nThat ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung\\nLike Night, and darken’d all the Land of _Nile_:\\nSo numberless were those bad Angels seen\\nHovering on wing under the Cope of Hell\\n’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\\nTill, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear\\nOf their great Sultan waving to direct\\nThir course, in even ballance down they light\\nOn the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;\\nA multitude, like which the populous North\\nPour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass\\n_Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons\\nCame like a Deluge on the South, and spread\\nBeneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands.\\nForthwith from every Squadron and each Band\\nThe Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\\nTheir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms\\nExcelling human, Princely Dignities,\\nAnd Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;\\nThough of their Names in heav’nly Records now\\nBe no memorial, blotted out and ras’d\\nBy thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\\nNor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_\\nGot them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,\\nThrough Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\\nBy falsities and lyes the greatest part\\nOf Mankind they corrupted to forsake\\nGod their Creator, and th’ invisible\\nGlory of him, that made them, to transform\\nOft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d\\nWith gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\\nAnd Devils to adore for Deities:\\nThen were they known to men by various Names,\\nAnd various Idols through the Heathen World.\\nSay, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,\\nRous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\\nAt thir great Emperors call, as next in worth\\nCame singly where he stood on the bare strand,\\nWhile the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?\\nThe chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\\nRoaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix\\nTheir Seats long after next the Seat of God,\\nTheir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d\\nAmong the Nations round, and durst abide\\n_Jehovah_ thundring out of _Sion_, thron’d\\nBetween the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d\\nWithin his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,\\nAbominations; and with cursed things\\nHis holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,\\nAnd with their darkness durst affront his light.\\nFirst _Moloch_, horrid King besmear’d with blood\\nOf human sacrifice, and parents tears,\\nThough for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\\nTheir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\\nTo his grim Idol.  Him the _Ammonite_\\nWorshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain,\\nIn _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream\\nOf utmost _Arnon_.  Nor content with such\\nAudacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\\nOf _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build\\nHis Temple right against the Temple of God\\nOn that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\\nThe pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence\\nAnd black _Gehenna_ call’d, the Type of Hell.\\nNext _Chemos_, th’ obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons,\\nFrom _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild\\nOf Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_\\nAnd _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond\\nThe flowry Dale of _Sibma_ clad with Vines,\\nAnd _Eleale_ to th’ _Asphaltick_ Pool.\\n_Peor_ his other Name, when he entic’d\\n_Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_\\nTo do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\\nYet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d\\nEven to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove\\nOf _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate;\\nTill good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell.\\nWith these came they, who from the bordring flood\\nOf old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts\\n_Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names\\nOf _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male,\\nThese Feminine.  For Spirits when they please\\nCan either Sex assume, or both; so soft\\nAnd uncompounded is their Essence pure,\\nNot ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,\\nNor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\\nLike cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\\nDilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,\\nCan execute their aerie purposes,\\nAnd works of love or enmity fulfill.\\nFor those the Race of _Israel_ oft forsook\\nTheir living strength, and unfrequented left\\nHis righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\\nTo bestial Gods; for which their heads as low\\nBow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\\nOf despicable foes.  With these in troop\\nCame _Astoreth_, whom the _Phoenicians_ call’d\\n_Astarte_, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;\\nTo whose bright Image nightly by the Moon\\n_Sidonian_ Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,\\nIn _Sion_ also not unsung, where stood\\nHer Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built\\nBy that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\\nBeguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell\\nTo Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind,\\nWhose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allur’d\\nThe _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate\\nIn amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\\nWhile smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock\\nRan purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood\\nOf _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale\\nInfected _Sions_ daughters with like heat,\\nWhose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\\n_Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led\\nHis eye survay’d the dark Idolatries\\nOf alienated _Judah_.  Next came one\\nWho mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark\\nMaim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off\\nIn his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,\\nWhere he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:\\n_Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\\nAnd downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\\nRear’d in _Azotus_, dreaded through the Coast\\nOf _Palestine_, in _Gath_ and _Ascalon_,\\nAnd _Accaron_ and _Gaza’s_ frontier bounds.\\nHim follow’d _Rimmon_, whose delightful Seat\\nWas fair _Damscus_, on the fertil Banks\\nOf _Abbana_ and _Pharphar_, lucid streams.\\nHe also against the house of God was bold:\\nA Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,\\n_Ahaz_ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\\nGods Altar to disparage and displace\\nFor one of _Syrian_ mode, whereon to burn\\nHis odious offrings, and adore the Gods\\nWhom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d\\nA crew who under Names of old Renown,\\n_Osiris_, _Isis_, _Orus_ and their Train\\nWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d\\nFanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek\\nThir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms\\nRather then human.  Nor did _Israel_ scape\\nTh’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d\\nThe Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King\\nDoubl’d that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_,\\nLik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\\n_Jehovah_, who in one Night when he pass’d\\nFrom _Egypt_ marching, equal’d with one stroke\\nBoth her first born and all her bleating Gods.\\n_Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\\nVice for it self: To him no Temple stood\\nOr Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee\\nIn Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\\nTurns Atheist, as did _Ely’s_ Sons, who fill’d\\nWith lust and violence the house of God.\\nIn Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\\nAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\\nOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\\nAnd injury and outrage: And when Night\\nDarkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\\nOf _Belial_, flown with insolence and wine.\\nWitness the Streets of _Sodom_, and that night\\nIn _Gibeah_, when hospitable Dores\\nYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\\nThese were the prime in order and in might;\\nThe rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,\\nTh’ _Ionian_ Gods, of _Javans_ Issue held\\nGods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth\\nThir boasted Parents; _Titan_ Heav’ns first born\\nWith his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d\\nBy younger _Saturn_, he from mightier _Jove_\\nHis own and _Rhea’s_ Son like measure found;\\nSo _Jove_ usurping reign’d: these first in _Creet_\\nAnd _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top\\nOf cold _Olympus_ rul’d the middle Air\\nThir highest Heav’n; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff,\\nOr in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds\\nOf _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old\\nFled over _Adria_ to th’ _Hesperian_ Fields,\\nAnd ore the _Celtic_ roam’d the utmost Isles.\\nAll these and more came flocking; but with looks\\nDown cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d\\nObscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\\nNot in despair, to have found themselves not lost\\nIn loss it self; which on his count’nance cast\\nLike doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\\nSoon recollecting, with high words, that bore\\nSemblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d\\nTheir fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.\\nThen strait commands that at the warlike sound\\nOf Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\\nHis mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d\\n_Azazel_ as his right, a Cherube tall:\\nWho forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\\nTh’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t\\nShon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\\nWith Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,\\nSeraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\\nSonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\\nAt which the universal Host upsent\\nA shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\\nFrighted the Reign of _Chaos_ and old Night.\\nAll in a moment through the gloom were seen\\nTen thousand Banners rise into the Air\\nWith Orient Colours waving: with them rose\\nA Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\\nAppear’d, and serried Shields in thick array\\nOf depth immeasurable: Anon they move\\nIn perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood\\nOf Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d\\nTo highth of noblest temper Hero’s old\\nArming to Battel, and in stead of rage\\nDeliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d\\nWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\\nNor wanting power to mitigate and swage\\nWith solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase\\nAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\\nFrom mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they\\nBreathing united force with fixed thought\\nMov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d\\nThir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now\\nAdvanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front\\nOf dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\\nOf Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,\\nAwaiting what command thir mighty Chief\\nHad to impose: He through the armed Files\\nDarts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse\\nThe whole Battalion views, thir order due,\\nThir visages and stature as of Gods,\\nThir number last he summs.  And now his heart\\nDistends with pride, and hardning in his strength\\nGlories: For never since created man,\\nMet such imbodied force, as nam’d with these\\nCould merit more then that small infantry\\nWarr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\\nOf _Phlegra_ with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d\\nThat fought at _Theb’s_ and _Ilium_, on each side\\nMixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\\nIn Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son\\nBegirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights;\\nAnd all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel\\nJousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_,\\n_Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_,\\nOr whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore\\nWhen _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell\\nBy _Fontarabbia_.  Thus far these beyond\\nCompare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d\\nThir dread Commander: he above the rest\\nIn shape and gesture proudly eminent\\nStood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\\nAll her Original brightness, nor appear’d\\nLess then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess\\nOf Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n\\nLooks through the Horizontal misty Air\\nShorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\\nIn dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\\nOn half the Nations, and with fear of change\\nPerplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon\\nAbove them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face\\nDeep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\\nSat on his faded cheek, but under Browes\\nOf dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\\nWaiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast\\nSigns of remorse and passion to behold\\nThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather\\n(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d\\nFor ever now to have their lot in pain,\\nMillions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t\\nOf Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung\\nFor his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\\nThir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire\\nHath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,\\nWith singed top their stately growth though bare\\nStands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d\\nTo speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend\\nFrom Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round\\nWith all his Peers: attention held them mute.\\nThrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,\\nTears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last\\nWords interwove with sighs found out their way.\\n\\nO Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers\\nMatchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife\\nWas not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,\\nAs this place testifies, and this dire change\\nHateful to utter: but what power of mind\\nForeseeing or presaging, from the Depth\\nOf knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,\\nHow such united force of Gods, how such\\nAs stood like these, could ever know repulse?\\nFor who can yet beleeve, though after loss,\\nThat all these puissant Legions, whose exile\\nHath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend\\nSelf-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.\\nFor me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,\\nIf counsels different, or danger shun’d\\nBy me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns\\nMonarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure\\nSat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,\\nConsent or custome, and his Regal State\\nPut forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,\\nWhich tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.\\nHenceforth his might we know, and know our own\\nSo as not either to provoke, or dread\\nNew warr, provok’t; our better part remains\\nTo work in close design, by fraud or guile\\nWhat force effected not: that he no less\\nAt length from us may find, who overcomes\\nBy force, hath overcome but half his foe.\\nSpace may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife\\nThere went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long\\nIntended to create, and therein plant\\nA generation, whom his choice regard\\nShould favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:\\nThither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps\\nOur first eruption, thither or elsewhere:\\nFor this Infernal Pit shall never hold\\nCaelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse\\nLong under darkness cover.  But these thoughts\\nFull Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,\\nFor who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr\\nOpen or understood must be resolv’d.\\n\\nHe spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew\\nMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\\nOf mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze\\nFar round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d\\nAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s\\nClash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,\\nHurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.\\n\\nThere stood a Hill not far whose griesly top\\nBelch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire\\nShon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign\\nThat in his womb was hid metallic Ore,\\nThe work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed\\nA numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands\\nOf Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d\\nForerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,\\nOr cast a Rampart.  _Mammon_ led them on,\\n_Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell\\nFrom heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks & thoughts\\nWere always downward bent, admiring more\\nThe riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,\\nThen aught divine or holy else enjoy’d\\nIn vision beatific: by him first\\nMen also, and by his suggestion taught,\\nRansack’d the Center, and with impious hands\\nRifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth\\nFor Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew\\nOp’nd into the Hill a spacious wound\\nAnd dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire\\nThat riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best\\nDeserve the pretious bane.  And here let those\\nWho boast in mortal things, and wondring tell\\nOf _Babel_, and the works of _Memphian_ Kings,\\nLearn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,\\nAnd Strength and Art are easily outdone\\nBy Spirits reprobate, and in an hour\\nWhat in an age they with incessant toyle\\nAnd hands innumerable scarce perform\\nNigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,\\nThat underneath had veins of liquid fire\\nSluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude\\nWith wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,\\nSevering each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:\\nA third as soon had form’d within the ground\\nA various mould, and from the boyling cells\\nBy strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,\\nAs in an Organ from one blast of wind\\nTo many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.\\nAnon out of the earth a Fabrick huge\\nRose like an Exhalation, with the sound\\nOf Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,\\nBuilt like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round\\nWere set, and Doric pillars overlaid\\nWith Golden Architrave; nor did there want\\nCornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,\\nThe Roof was fretted Gold.  Not _Babilon_,\\nNor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence\\nEqual’d in all thir glories, to inshrine\\n_Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat\\nThir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove\\nIn wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile\\nStood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores\\nOp’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide\\nWithin, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth\\nAnd level pavement: from the arched roof\\nPendant by suttle Magic many a row\\nOf Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed\\nWith Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light\\nAs from a sky.  The hasty multitude\\nAdmiring enter’d, and the work some praise\\nAnd some the Architect: his hand was known\\nIn Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,\\nWhere Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,\\nAnd sat as Princes, whom the supreme King\\nExalted to such power, and gave to rule,\\nEach in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.\\nNor was his name unheard or unador’d\\nIn ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land\\nMen call’d him _Mulciber_; and how he fell\\nFrom Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry _Jove_\\nSheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn\\nTo Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,\\nA Summers day; and with the setting Sun\\nDropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,\\nOn _Lemnos_ th’ _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate,\\nErring; for he with this rebellious rout\\nFell long before; nor aught avail’d him now\\nTo have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape\\nBy all his Engins, but was headlong sent\\nWith his industrious crew to build in hell.\\nMean while the winged Haralds by command\\nOf Sovran power, with awful Ceremony\\nAnd Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim\\nA solemn Councel forthwith to be held\\nAt _Pandaemonium_, the high Capital\\nOf Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d\\nFrom every and Band squared Regiment\\nBy place or choice the worthiest; they anon\\nWith hundreds and with thousands trooping came\\nAttended: all access was throng’d, the Gates\\nAnd Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall\\n(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold\\nWont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair\\nDefi’d the best of Panim chivalry\\nTo mortal combat or carreer with Lance)\\nThick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,\\nBrusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees\\nIn spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,\\nPoure forth thir populous youth about the Hive\\nIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\\nFlie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,\\nThe suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,\\nNew rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer\\nThir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd\\nSwarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,\\nBehold a wonder! they but now who seemd\\nIn bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons\\nNow less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room\\nThrong numberless, like that Pigmean Race\\nBeyond the _Indian_ Mount, or Faerie Elves,\\nWhose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side\\nOr Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,\\nOr dreams he sees, while over head the Moon\\nSits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth\\nWheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance\\nIntent, with jocond Music charm his ear;\\nAt once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.\\nThus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms\\nReduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,\\nThough without number still amidst the Hall\\nOf that infernal Court.  But far within\\nAnd in thir own dimensions like themselves\\nThe great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim\\nIn close recess and secret conclave sat\\nA thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,\\nFrequent and full.  After short silence then\\nAnd summons read, the great consult began.\\n\\n      THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.\\n\\n  PARADISE LOST\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  BOOK II.\\n\\nHigh on a Throne of Royal State, which far\\nOutshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_,\\nOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand\\nShowrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl & Gold,\\nSatan exalted sat, by merit rais’d\\nTo that bad eminence; and from despair\\nThus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires\\nBeyond thus high, insatiate to pursue\\nVain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught\\nHis proud imaginations thus displaid.\\n\\nPowers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,\\nFor since no deep within her gulf can hold\\nImmortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,\\nI give not Heav’n for lost.  From this descent\\nCelestial vertues rising, will appear\\nMore glorious and more dread then from no fall,\\nAnd trust themselves to fear no second fate:\\nMee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n\\nDid first create your Leader, next, free choice,\\nWith what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,\\nHath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss\\nThus farr at least recover’d, hath much more\\nEstablisht in a safe unenvied Throne\\nYeilded with full consent.  The happier state\\nIn Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw\\nEnvy from each inferior; but who here\\nWill envy whom the highest place exposes\\nFormost to stand against the Thunderers aime\\nYour bulwark, and condemns to greatest share\\nOf endless pain? where there is then no good\\nFor which to strive, no strife can grow up there\\nFrom Faction; for none sure will claim in hell\\nPrecedence, none, whose portion is so small\\nOf present pain, that with ambitious mind\\nWill covet more.  With this advantage then\\nTo union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,\\nMore then can be in Heav’n, we now return\\nTo claim our just inheritance of old,\\nSurer to prosper then prosperity\\nCould have assur’d us; and by what best way,\\nWhether of open Warr or covert guile,\\nWe now debate; who can advise, may speak.\\n\\nHe ceas’d, and next him _Moloc_, Scepter’d King\\nStood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit\\nThat fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair:\\nHis trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d\\nEqual in strength, and rather then be less\\nCar’d not to be at all; with that care lost\\nWent all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse\\nHe reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.\\n\\nMy sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,\\nMore unexpert, I boast not: them let those\\nContrive who need, or when they need, not now.\\nFor while they sit contriving, shall the rest,\\nMillions that stand in Arms, and longing wait\\nThe Signal to ascend, sit lingring here\\nHeav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place\\nAccept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,\\nThe Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns\\nBy our delay? no, let us rather choose\\nArm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once\\nO’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way,\\nTurning our Tortures into horrid Arms\\nAgainst the Torturer; when to meet the noise\\nOf his Almighty Engin he shall hear\\nInfernal Thunder, and for Lightning see\\nBlack fire and horror shot with equal rage\\nAmong his Angels; and his Throne it self\\nMixt with _Tartarean_ Sulphur, and strange fire,\\nHis own invented Torments.  But perhaps\\nThe way seems difficult and steep to scale\\nWith upright wing against a higher foe.\\nLet such bethink them, if the sleepy drench\\nOf that forgetful Lake benumme not still,\\nThat in our proper motion we ascend\\nUp to our native seat: descent and fall\\nTo us is adverse.  Who but felt of late\\nWhen the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear\\nInsulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,\\nWith what compulsion and laborious flight\\nWe sunk thus low?  Th’ ascent is easie then;\\nTh’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke\\nOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may find\\nTo our destruction: if there be in Hell\\nFear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse\\nThen to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d\\nIn this abhorred deep to utter woe;\\nWhere pain of unextinguishable fire\\nMust exercise us without hope of end\\nThe Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge\\nInexorably, and the torturing houre\\nCalls us to Penance?  More destroy’d then thus\\nWe should be quite abolisht and expire.\\nWhat fear we then? what doubt we to incense\\nHis utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d,\\nWill either quite consume us, and reduce\\nTo nothing this essential, happier farr\\nThen miserable to have eternal being:\\nOr if our substance be indeed Divine,\\nAnd cannot cease to be, we are at worst\\nOn this side nothing; and by proof we feel\\nOur power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,\\nAnd with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,\\nThough inaccessible, his fatal Throne:\\nWhich if not Victory is yet Revenge.\\n\\nHe ended frowning, and his look denounc’d\\nDesperate revenge, and Battel dangerous\\nTo less then Gods.  On th’ other side up rose\\n_Belial_, in act more graceful and humane;\\nA fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd\\nFor dignity compos’d and high exploit:\\nBut all was false and hollow; though his Tongue\\nDropt Manna, and could make the worse appear\\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\\nMaturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;\\nTo vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds\\nTimorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the eare,\\nAnd with perswasive accent thus began.\\n\\nI should be much for open Warr, O Peers,\\nAs not behind in hate; if what was urg’d\\nMain reason to perswade immediate Warr,\\nDid not disswade me most, and seem to cast\\nOminous conjecture on the whole success:\\nWhen he who most excels in fact of Arms,\\nIn what he counsels and in what excels\\nMistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\\nAnd utter dissolution, as the scope\\nOf all his aim, after some dire revenge.\\nFirst, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d\\nWith Armed watch, that render all access\\nImpregnable; oft on the bordering Deep\\nEncamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing\\nScout farr and wide into the Realm of night,\\nScorning surprize.  Or could we break our way\\nBy force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\\nWith blackest Insurrection, to confound\\nHeav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie\\nAll incorruptible would on his Throne\\nSit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould\\nIncapable of stain would soon expel\\nHer mischief, and purge off the baser fire\\nVictorious.  Thus repuls’d, our final hope\\nIs flat despair: we must exasperate\\nTh’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\\nAnd that must end us, that must be our cure,\\nTo be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\\nThough full of pain, this intellectual being,\\nThose thoughts that wander through Eternity,\\nTo perish rather, swallowd up and lost\\nIn the wide womb of uncreated night,\\nDevoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\\nLet this be good, whether our angry Foe\\nCan give it, or will ever? how he can\\nIs doubtful; that he never will is sure.\\nWill he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\\nBelike through impotence, or unaware,\\nTo give his Enemies thir wish, and end\\nThem in his anger, whom his anger saves\\nTo punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\\nSay they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,\\nReserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe;\\nWhatever doing, what can we suffer more,\\nWhat can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\\nThus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\\nWhat when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook\\nWith Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought\\nThe Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d\\nA refuge from those wounds: or when we lay\\nChain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\\nWhat if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires\\nAwak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage\\nAnd plunge us in the Flames? or from above\\nShould intermitted vengeance Arme again\\nHis red right hand to plague us? what if all\\nHer stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament\\nOf Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\\nImpendent horrors, threatning hideous fall\\nOne day upon our heads; while we perhaps\\nDesigning or exhorting glorious Warr,\\nCaught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d\\nEach on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey\\nOf racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\\nUnder yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;\\nThere to converse with everlasting groans,\\nUnrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,\\nAges of hopeless end; this would be worse.\\nWarr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike\\nMy voice disswades; for what can force or guile\\nWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\\nViews all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth\\nAll these our motions vain, sees and derides;\\nNot more Almighty to resist our might\\nThen wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\\nShall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n\\nThus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here\\nChains & these Torments? better these then worse\\nBy my advice; since fate inevitable\\nSubdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,\\nThe Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,\\nOur strength is equal, nor the Law unjust\\nThat so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,\\nIf we were wise, against so great a foe\\nContending, and so doubtful what might fall.\\nI laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\\nAnd vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear\\nWhat yet they know must follow, to endure\\nExile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\\nThe sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now\\nOur doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\\nOur Supream Foe in time may much remit\\nHis anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d\\nNot mind us not offending, satisfi’d\\nWith what is punish’t; whence these raging fires\\nWill slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames.\\nOur purer essence then will overcome\\nThir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,\\nOr chang’d at length, and to the place conformd\\nIn temper and in nature, will receive\\nFamiliar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\\nThis horror will grow milde, this darkness light,\\nBesides what hope the never-ending flight\\nOf future days may bring, what chance, what change\\nWorth waiting, since our present lot appeers\\nFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\\nIf we procure not to our selves more woe.\\n\\nThus _Belial_ with words cloath’d in reasons garb\\nCounsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,\\nNot peace: and after him thus _Mammon_ spake.\\n\\nEither to disinthrone the King of Heav’n\\nWe warr, if warr be best, or to regain\\nOur own right lost: him to unthrone we then\\nMay hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild\\nTo fickle Chance, and _Chaos_ judge the strife:\\nThe former vain to hope argues as vain\\nThe latter: for what place can be for us\\nWithin Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream\\nWe overpower?  Suppose he should relent\\nAnd publish Grace to all, on promise made\\nOf new Subjection; with what eyes could we\\nStand in his presence humble, and receive\\nStrict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne\\nWith warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\\nForc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits\\nOur envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes\\nAmbrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,\\nOur servile offerings.  This must be our task\\nIn Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom\\nEternity so spent in worship paid\\nTo whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue\\nBy force impossible, by leave obtain’d\\nUnacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state\\nOf splendid vassalage, but rather seek\\nOur own good from our selves, and from our own\\nLive to our selves, though in this vast recess,\\nFree, and to none accountable, preferring\\nHard liberty before the easie yoke\\nOf servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear\\nThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,\\nUseful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\\nWe can create, and in what place so e’re\\nThrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\\nThrough labour and endurance.  This deep world\\nOf darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst\\nThick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire\\nChoose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d,\\nAnd with the Majesty of darkness round\\nCovers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar\\nMust’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?\\nAs he our Darkness, cannot we his Light\\nImitate when we please?  This Desart soile\\nWants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;\\nNor want we skill or art, from whence to raise\\nMagnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?\\nOur torments also may in length of time\\nBecome our Elements, these piercing Fires\\nAs soft as now severe, our temper chang’d\\nInto their temper; which must needs remove\\nThe sensible of pain.  All things invite\\nTo peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State\\nOf order, how in safety best we may\\nCompose our present evils, with regard\\nOf what we are and where, dismissing quite\\nAll thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.\\n\\nHe scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\\nTh’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\\nThe sound of blustring winds, which all night long\\nHad rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\\nSea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\\nOr Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\\nAfter the Tempest: Such applause was heard\\nAs _Mammon_ ended, and his Sentence pleas’d,\\nAdvising peace: for such another Field\\nThey dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\\nOf Thunder and the Sword of _Michael_\\nWrought still within them; and no less desire\\nTo found this nether Empire, which might rise\\nBy pollicy, and long process of time,\\nIn emulation opposite to Heav’n.\\nWhich when _Beelzebub_ perceiv’d, then whom,\\n_Satan_ except, none higher sat, with grave\\nAspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d\\nA Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\\nDeliberation sat and publick care;\\nAnd Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\\nMajestick though in ruin: sage he stood\\nWith _Atlantean_ shoulders fit to bear\\nThe weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\\nDrew audience and attention still as Night\\nOr Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\\n\\nThrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n,\\nEthereal Vertues; or these Titles now\\nMust we renounce, and changing stile be call’d\\nPrinces of Hell? for so the popular vote\\nInclines, here to continue, and build up here\\nA growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,\\nAnd know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d\\nThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\\nBeyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\\nFrom Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League\\nBanded against his Throne, but to remaine\\nIn strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d,\\nUnder th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d\\nHis captive multitude: For he, be sure,\\nIn highth or depth, still first and last will Reign\\nSole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part\\nBy our revolt, but over Hell extend\\nHis Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule\\nUs here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n.\\nWhat sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?\\nWarr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss\\nIrreparable; tearms of peace yet none\\nVoutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n\\nTo us enslav’d, but custody severe,\\nAnd stripes, and arbitrary punishment\\nInflicted? and what peace can we return,\\nBut to our power hostility and hate,\\nUntam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow,\\nYet ever plotting how the Conquerour least\\nMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce\\nIn doing what we most in suffering feel?\\nNor will occasion want, nor shall we need\\nWith dangerous expedition to invade\\nHeav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\\nOr ambush from the Deep.  What if we find\\nSome easier enterprize?  There is a place\\n(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n\\nErr not) another World, the happy seat\\nOf som new Race call’d _Man_, about this time\\nTo be created like to us, though less\\nIn power and excellence, but favour’d more\\nOf him who rules above; so was his will\\nPronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,\\nThat shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.\\nThither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\\nWhat creatures there inhabit, of what mould,\\nOr substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,\\nAnd where thir weakness, how attempted best,\\nBy force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,\\nAnd Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure\\nIn his own strength, this place may lye expos’d\\nThe utmost border of his Kingdom, left\\nTo their defence who hold it: here perhaps\\nSom advantagious act may be achiev’d\\nBy sudden onset, either with Hell fire\\nTo waste his whole Creation, or possess\\nAll as our own, and drive as we were driven,\\nThe punie habitants, or if not drive,\\nSeduce them to our Party, that thir God\\nMay prove thir foe, and with repenting hand\\nAbolish his own works.  This would surpass\\nCommon revenge, and interrupt his joy\\nIn our Confusion, and our Joy upraise\\nIn his disturbance; when his darling Sons\\nHurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse\\nThir frail Originals, and faded bliss,\\nFaded so soon.  Advise if this be worth\\nAttempting, or to sit in darkness here\\nHatching vain Empires.  Thus _Beelzebub_\\nPleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d\\nBy _Satan_, and in part propos’d: for whence,\\nBut from the Author of all ill could Spring\\nSo deep a malice, to confound the race\\nOf mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\\nTo mingle and involve, done all to spite\\nThe great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves\\nHis glory to augment.  The bold design\\nPleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy\\nSparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent\\nThey vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\\n\\nWell have ye judg’d, well ended long debate,\\nSynod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\\nGreat things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep\\nWill once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\\nNeerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\\nOf those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\\nAnd opportune excursion we may chance\\nRe-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone\\nDwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light\\nSecure, and at the brightning Orient beam\\nPurge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\\nTo heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\\nShall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send\\nIn search of this new world, whom shall we find\\nSufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\\nThe dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss\\nAnd through the palpable obscure find out\\nHis uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\\nUpborn with indefatigable wings\\nOver the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\\nThe happy Ile; what strength, what art can then\\nSuffice, or what evasion bear him safe\\nThrough the strict Senteries and Stations thick\\nOf Angels watching round?  Here he had need\\nAll circumspection, and we now no less\\nChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\\nThe weight of all and our last hope relies.\\n\\nThis said, he sat; and expectation held\\nHis look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d\\nTo second, or oppose, or undertake\\nThe perilous attempt: but all sat mute,\\nPondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each\\nIn others count’nance red his own dismay\\nAstonisht: none among the choice and prime\\nOf those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found\\nSo hardie as to proffer or accept\\nAlone the dreadful voyage; till at last\\n_Satan_, whom now transcendent glory rais’d\\nAbove his fellows, with Monarchal pride\\nConscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.\\n\\nO Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones,\\nWith reason hath deep silence and demurr\\nSeis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way\\nAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;\\nOur prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,\\nOutrageous to devour, immures us round\\nNinefold, and gates of burning Adamant\\nBarr’d over us prohibit all egress.\\nThese past, if any pass, the void profound\\nOf unessential Night receives him next\\nWide gaping, and with utter loss of being\\nThreatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.\\nIf thence he scape into what ever world,\\nOr unknown Region, what remains him less\\nThen unknown dangers and as hard escape.\\nBut I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,\\nAnd this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d\\nWith splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d\\nAnd judg’d of public moment, in the shape\\nOf difficulty or danger could deterre\\nMe from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume\\nThese Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,\\nRefusing to accept as great a share\\nOf hazard as of honour, due alike\\nTo him who Reigns, and so much to him due\\nOf hazard more, as he above the rest\\nHigh honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,\\nTerror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,\\nWhile here shall be our home, what best may ease\\nThe present misery, and render Hell\\nMore tollerable; if there be cure or charm\\nTo respite or deceive, or slack the pain\\nOf this ill Mansion: intermit no watch\\nAgainst a wakeful Foe, while I abroad\\nThrough all the coasts of dark destruction seek\\nDeliverance for us all: this enterprize\\nNone shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose\\nThe Monarch, and prevented all reply,\\nPrudent, least from his resolution rais’d\\nOthers among the chief might offer now\\n(Certain to be refus’d) what erst they feard;\\nAnd so refus’d might in opinion stand\\nHis rivals, winning cheap the high repute\\nWhich he through hazard huge must earn.  But they\\nDreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice\\nForbidding; and at once with him they rose;\\nThir rising all at once was as the sound\\nOf Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend\\nWith awful reverence prone; and as a God\\nExtoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:\\nNor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d,\\nThat for the general safety he despis’d\\nHis own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d\\nLoose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast\\nThir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,\\nOr close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal.\\nThus they thir doubtful consultations dark\\nEnded rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:\\nAs when from mountain tops the dusky clouds\\nAscending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread\\nHeav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element\\nScowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;\\nIf chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet\\nExtend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,\\nThe birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds\\nAttest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.\\nO shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn’d\\nFirm concord holds, men onely disagree\\nOf Creatures rational, though under hope\\nOf heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,\\nYet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife\\nAmong themselves, and levie cruel warres,\\nWasting the Earth, each other to destroy:\\nAs if (which might induce us to accord)\\nMan had not hellish foes anow besides,\\nThat day and night for his destruction waite.\\n\\nThe _Stygian_ Councel thus dissolv’d; and forth\\nIn order came the grand infernal Peers,\\nMidst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd\\nAlone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less\\nThen Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,\\nAnd God-like imitated State; him round\\nA Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d\\nWith bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.\\nThen of thir Session ended they bid cry\\nWith Trumpets regal sound the great result:\\nToward the four winds four speedy Cherubim\\nPut to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie\\nBy Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss\\nHeard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell\\nWith deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim.\\nThence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d\\nBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers\\nDisband, and wandring, each his several way\\nPursues, as inclination or sad choice\\nLeads him perplext, where he may likeliest find\\nTruce to his restless thoughts, and entertain\\nThe irksome hours, till his great Chief return.\\nPart on the Plain, or in the Air sublime\\nUpon the wing, or in swift race contend,\\nAs at th’ Olympian Games or _Pythian_ fields;\\nPart curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal\\nWith rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.\\nAs when to warn proud Cities warr appears\\nWag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush\\nTo Battel in the Clouds, before each Van\\nPric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears\\nTill thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms\\nFrom either end of Heav’n the welkin burns.\\nOthers with vast _Typhoean_ rage more fell\\nRend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air\\nIn whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.\\nAs when _Alcides_ from _Oealia_ Crown’d\\nWith conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore\\nThrough pain up by the roots _Thessalian_ Pines,\\nAnd _Lichas_ from the top of _Oeta_ threw\\nInto th’ _Euboic_ Sea.  Others more milde,\\nRetreated in a silent valley, sing\\nWith notes Angelical to many a Harp\\nThir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall\\nBy doom of Battel; and complain that Fate\\nFree Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.\\nThir song was partial, but the harmony\\n(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)\\nSuspended Hell, and took with ravishment\\nThe thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet\\n(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)\\nOthers apart sat on a Hill retir’d,\\nIn thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high\\nOf Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,\\nFixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\\nAnd found no end, in wandring mazes lost.\\nOf good and evil much they argu’d then,\\nOf happiness and final misery,\\nPassion and Apathie, and glory and shame,\\nVain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:\\nYet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm\\nPain for a while or anguish, and excite\\nFallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest\\nWith stubborn patience as with triple steel.\\nAnother part in Squadrons and gross Bands,\\nOn bold adventure to discover wide\\nThat dismal world, if any Clime perhaps\\nMight yeild them easier habitation, bend\\nFour ways thir flying March, along the Banks\\nOf four infernal Rivers that disgorge\\nInto the burning Lake thir baleful streams;\\nAbhorred _Styx_ the flood of deadly hate,\\nSad _Acheron_ of sorrow, black and deep;\\n_Cocytus_, nam’d of lamentation loud\\nHeard on the ruful stream; fierce _Phlegeton_\\nWhose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\\nFarr off from these a slow and silent stream,\\n_Lethe_ the River of Oblivion roules\\nHer watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,\\nForthwith his former state and being forgets,\\nForgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.\\nBeyond this flood a frozen Continent\\nLies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms\\nOf Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land\\nThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems\\nOf ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,\\nA gulf profound as that _Serbonian_ Bog\\nBetwixt _Damiata_ and mount _Casius_ old,\\nWhere Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air\\nBurns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire.\\nThither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d,\\nAt certain revolutions all the damn’d\\nAre brought: and feel by turns the bitter change\\nOf fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,\\nFrom Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice\\nThir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine\\nImmovable, infixt, and frozen round,\\nPeriods of time, thence hurried back to fire.\\nThey ferry over this _Lethean_ Sound\\nBoth to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,\\nAnd wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach\\nThe tempting stream, with one small drop to loose\\nIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,\\nAll in one moment, and so neer the brink;\\nBut fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt\\n_Medusa_ with _Gorgonian_ terror guards\\nThe Ford, and of it self the water flies\\nAll taste of living wight, as once it fled\\nThe lip of _Tantalus_.  Thus roving on\\nIn confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands\\nWith shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast\\nView’d first thir lamentable lot, and found\\nNo rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile\\nThey pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,\\nO’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,\\nRocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,\\nA Universe of death, which God by curse\\nCreated evil, for evil only good,\\nWhere all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,\\nPerverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,\\nAbominable, inutterable, and worse\\nThen Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,\\n_Gorgons_ and _Hydra’s_, and _Chimera’s_ dire.\\n\\nMean while the Adversary of God and Man,\\n_Satan_ with thoughts inflam’d of highest design,\\nPuts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell\\nExplores his solitary flight; som times\\nHe scours the right hand coast, som times the left,\\nNow shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares\\nUp to the fiery concave touring high.\\nAs when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d\\nHangs in the Clouds, by _Aequinoctial_ Winds\\nClose sailing from _Bengala_, or the Iles\\nOf _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring\\nThir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood\\nThrough the wide _Ethiopian_ to the Cape\\nPly stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem’d\\nFarr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer\\nHell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,\\nAnd thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass\\nThree Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,\\nImpenitrable, impal’d with circling fire,\\nYet unconsum’d.  Before the Gates there sat\\nOn either side a formidable shape;\\nThe one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair,\\nBut ended foul in many a scaly fould\\nVoluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d\\nWith mortal sting: about her middle round\\nA cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d\\nWith wide _Cerberean_ mouths full loud, and rung\\nA hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\\nIf aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb,\\nAnd kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d\\nWithin unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these\\nVex’d _Scylla_ bathing in the Sea that parts\\n_Calabria_ from the hoarce _Trinacrian_ shore:\\nNor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d\\nIn secret, riding through the Air she comes\\nLur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance\\nWith _Lapland_ Witches, while the labouring Moon\\nEclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,\\nIf shape it might be call’d that shape had none\\nDistinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,\\nOr substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,\\nFor each seem’d either; black it stood as Night,\\nFierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\\nAnd shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head\\nThe likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.\\n_Satan_ was now at hand, and from his seat\\nThe Monster moving onward came as fast,\\nWith horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.\\nTh’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,\\nAdmir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except,\\nCreated thing naught vallu’d he nor shun’d;\\nAnd with disdainful look thus first began.\\n\\nWhence and what art thou, execrable shape,\\nThat dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance\\nThy miscreated Front athwart my way\\nTo yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\\nThat be assur’d, without leave askt of thee:\\nRetire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\\nHell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav’n.\\n\\nTo whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d,\\nArt thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,\\nWho first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then\\nUnbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms\\nDrew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons\\nConjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou\\nAnd they outcast from God, are here condemn’d\\nTo waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?\\nAnd reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,\\nHell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn,\\nWhere I reign King, and to enrage thee more,\\nThy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,\\nFalse fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,\\nLeast with a whip of Scorpions I pursue\\nThy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart\\nStrange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.\\n\\nSo spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,\\nSo speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold\\nMore dreadful and deform: on th’ other side\\nIncenc’t with indignation _Satan_ stood\\nUnterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,\\nThat fires the length of _Ophiucus_ huge\\nIn th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair\\nShakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head\\nLevel’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands\\nNo second stroke intend, and such a frown\\nEach cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds\\nWith Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on\\nOver the _Caspian_, then stand front to front\\nHov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow\\nTo joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:\\nSo frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell\\nGrew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;\\nFor never but once more was either like\\nTo meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\\nHad been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,\\nHad not the Snakie Sorceress that sat\\nFast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,\\nRis’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.\\n\\nO Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,\\nAgainst thy only Son?  What fury O Son,\\nPossesses thee to bend that mortal Dart\\nAgainst thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom;\\nFor him who sits above and laughs the while\\nAt thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute\\nWhat e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,\\nHis wrath which one day will destroy ye both.\\n\\nShe spake, and at her words the hellish Pest\\nForbore, then these to her _Satan_ return’d:\\n\\nSo strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\\nThou interposest, that my sudden hand\\nPrevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds\\nWhat it intends; till first I know of thee,\\nWhat thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why\\nIn this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st\\nMe Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son?\\nI know thee not, nor ever saw till now\\nSight more detestable then him and thee.\\n\\nT’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;\\nHast thou forgot me then, and do I seem\\nNow in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair\\nIn Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight\\nOf all the Seraphim with thee combin’d\\nIn bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,\\nAll on a sudden miserable pain\\nSurpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm\\nIn darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast\\nThrew forth, till on the left side op’ning wide,\\nLikest to thee in shape and count’nance bright,\\nThen shining heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d\\nOut of thy head I sprung: amazement seis’d\\nAll th’ Host of Heav’n; back they recoild affraid\\nAt first, and call’d me _Sin_, and for a Sign\\nPortentous held me; but familiar grown,\\nI pleas’d, and with attractive graces won\\nThe most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft\\nThy self in me thy perfect image viewing\\nBecam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st\\nWith me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d\\nA growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,\\nAnd fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind\\n(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe\\nCleer Victory, to our part loss and rout\\nThrough all the Empyrean: down they fell\\nDriv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down\\nInto this Deep, and in the general fall\\nI also; at which time this powerful Key\\nInto my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep\\nThese Gates for ever shut, which none can pass\\nWithout my op’ning.  Pensive here I sat\\nAlone, but long I sat not, till my womb\\nPregnant by thee, and now excessive grown\\nProdigious motion felt and rueful throes.\\nAt last this odious offspring whom thou seest\\nThine own begotten, breaking violent way\\nTore through my entrails, that with fear and pain\\nDistorted, all my nether shape thus grew\\nTransform’d: but he my inbred enemie\\nForth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart\\nMade to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out _Death_;\\nHell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d\\nFrom all her Caves, and back resounded _Death_.\\nI fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems,\\nInflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far,\\nMe overtook his mother all dismaid,\\nAnd in embraces forcible and foule\\nIngendring with me, of that rape begot\\nThese yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry\\nSurround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d\\nAnd hourly born, with sorrow infinite\\nTo me, for when they list into the womb\\nThat bred them they return, and howle and gnaw\\nMy Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth\\nAfresh with conscious terrours vex me round,\\nThat rest or intermission none I find.\\nBefore mine eyes in opposition sits\\nGrim _Death_ my Son and foe, who sets them on,\\nAnd me his Parent would full soon devour\\nFor want of other prey, but that he knows\\nHis end with mine involvd; and knows that I\\nShould prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,\\nWhen ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.\\nBut thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun\\nHis deadly arrow; neither vainly hope\\nTo be invulnerable in those bright Arms,\\nThough temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,\\nSave he who reigns above, none can resist.\\n\\nShe finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore\\nSoon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.\\nDear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,\\nAnd my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge\\nOf dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys\\nThen sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change\\nBefalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know\\nI come no enemie, but to set free\\nFrom out this dark and dismal house of pain,\\nBoth him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host\\nOf Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d\\nFell with us from on high: from them I go\\nThis uncouth errand sole, and one for all\\nMy self expose, with lonely steps to tread\\nTh’ unfounded deep, & through the void immense\\nTo search with wandring quest a place foretold\\nShould be, and, by concurring signs, ere now\\nCreated vast and round, a place of bliss\\nIn the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t\\nA race of upstart Creatures, to supply\\nPerhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d,\\nLeast Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude\\nMight hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught\\nThen this more secret now design’d, I haste\\nTo know, and this once known, shall soon return,\\nAnd bring ye to the place where Thou and Death\\nShall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\\nWing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d\\nWith odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d\\nImmeasurably, all things shall be your prey.\\nHe ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death\\nGrinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear\\nHis famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe\\nDestin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d\\nHis mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.\\n\\nThe key of this infernal Pit by due,\\nAnd by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King\\nI keep, by him forbidden to unlock\\nThese Adamantine Gates; against all force\\nDeath ready stands to interpose his dart,\\nFearless to be o’rematcht by living might.\\nBut what ow I to his commands above\\nWho hates me, and hath hither thrust me down\\nInto this gloom of _Tartarus_ profound,\\nTo sit in hateful Office here confin’d,\\nInhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born,\\nHere in perpetual agonie and pain,\\nWith terrors and with clamors compasst round\\nOf mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:\\nThou art my Father, thou my Author, thou\\nMy being gav’st me; whom should I obey\\nBut thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon\\nTo that new world of light and bliss, among\\nThe Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign\\nAt thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems\\nThy daughter and thy darling, without end.\\n\\nThus saying, from her side the fatal Key,\\nSad instrument of all our woe, she took;\\nAnd towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,\\nForthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,\\nWhich but her self not all the _Stygian_ powers\\nCould once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns\\nTh’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar\\nOf massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease\\nUnfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie\\nWith impetuous recoile and jarring sound\\nTh’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great\\nHarsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\\nOf _Erebus_.

Thy fear, said _Zephon_ bold,\\nWill save us trial what the least can doe\\nSingle against thee wicked, and thence weak.\\n\\nThe Fiend repli’d not, overcome with rage;\\nBut like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,\\nChaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie\\nHe held it vain; awe from above had quelld\\nHis heart, not else dismai’d.  Now drew they nigh\\nThe western point, where those half-rounding guards\\nJust met, & closing stood in squadron joind\\nAwaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief\\n_Gabriel_ from the Front thus calld aloud.\\n\\nO friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet\\nHasting this way, and now by glimps discerne\\n_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_ through the shade,\\nAnd with them comes a third of Regal port,\\nBut faded splendor wan; who by his gate\\nAnd fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,\\nNot likely to part hence without contest;\\nStand firm, for in his look defiance lours.\\n\\nHe scarce had ended, when those two approachd\\nAnd brief related whom they brought, wher found,\\nHow busied, in what form and posture coucht.\\n\\nTo whom with stern regard thus _Gabriel_ spake.\\nWhy hast thou, _Satan_, broke the bounds prescrib’d\\nTo thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge\\nOf others, who approve not to transgress\\nBy thy example, but have power and right\\nTo question thy bold entrance on this place;\\nImploi’d it seems to violate sleep, and those\\nWhose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?\\n\\nTo whom thus _Satan_ with contemptuous brow.\\n_Gabriel_, thou hadst in Heav’n th’ esteem of wise,\\nAnd such I held thee; but this question askt\\nPuts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?\\nWho would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,\\nThough thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,\\nAnd boldly venture to whatever place\\nFarthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change\\nTorment with ease, & soonest recompence\\nDole with delight, which in this place I sought;\\nTo thee no reason; who knowst only good,\\nBut evil hast not tri’d: and wilt object\\nHis will who bound us? let him surer barr\\nHis Iron Gates, if he intends our stay\\nIn that dark durance: thus much what was askt.\\nThe rest is true, they found me where they say;\\nBut that implies not violence or harme.\\n\\nThus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov’d,\\nDisdainfully half smiling thus repli’d.\\nO loss of one in Heav’n to judge of wise,\\nSince _Satan_ fell, whom follie overthrew,\\nAnd now returns him from his prison scap’t,\\nGravely in doubt whether to hold them wise\\nOr not, who ask what boldness brought him hither\\nUnlicenc’t from his bounds in Hell prescrib’d;\\nSo wise he judges it to fly from pain\\nHowever, and to scape his punishment.\\nSo judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,\\nWhich thou incurr’st by flying, meet thy flight\\nSeavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,\\nWhich taught thee yet no better, that no pain\\nCan equal anger infinite provok’t.\\nBut wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee\\nCame not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them\\nLess pain, less to be fled, or thou then they\\nLess hardie to endure? courageous Chief,\\nThe first in flight from pain, had’st thou alleg’d\\nTo thy deserted host this cause of flight,\\nThou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.\\n\\nTo which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.\\nNot that I less endure, or shrink from pain,\\nInsulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood\\nThy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide\\nThe blasting volied Thunder made all speed\\nAnd seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.\\nBut still thy words at random, as before,\\nArgue thy inexperience what behooves\\nFrom hard assaies and ill successes past\\nA faithful Leader, not to hazard all\\nThrough wayes of danger by himself untri’d.\\nI therefore, I alone first undertook\\nTo wing the desolate Abyss, and spie\\nThis new created World, whereof in Hell\\nFame is not silent, here in hope to find\\nBetter abode, and my afflicted Powers\\nTo settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;\\nThough for possession put to try once more\\nWhat thou and thy gay Legions dare against;\\nWhose easier business were to serve thir Lord\\nHigh up in Heav’n, with songs to hymne his Throne,\\nAnd practis’d distances to cringe, not fight.\\n\\nTo whom the warriour Angel soon repli’d.\\nTo say and strait unsay, pretending first\\nWise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,\\nArgues no Leader, but a lyar trac’t,\\n_Satan_, and couldst thou faithful add?

A while discourse they hold;\\nNo fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began\\nOur Authour.  Heav’nly stranger, please to taste\\nThese bounties which our Nourisher, from whom\\nAll perfet good unmeasur’d out, descends,\\nTo us for food and for delight hath caus’d\\nThe Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps\\nTo spiritual Natures; only this I know,\\nThat one Celestial Father gives to all.\\n\\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part\\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\\nNo ingrateful food: and food alike those pure\\nIntelligential substances require\\nAs doth your Rational; and both contain\\nWithin them every lower facultie\\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\\nTo be sustaind and fed; of Elements\\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\\nEarth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires\\nEthereal, and as lowest first the Moon;\\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurg’d\\nVapours not yet into her substance turnd.\\nNor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale\\nFrom her moist Continent to higher Orbes.\\nThe Sun that light imparts to all, receives\\nFrom all his alimental recompence\\nIn humid exhalations, and at Even\\nSups with the Ocean: though in Heav’n the Trees\\nOf life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines\\nYeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn\\nWe brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground\\nCover’d with pearly grain: yet God hath here\\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\\nAnd to thir viands fell, nor seemingly\\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\\nOf Theologians, but with keen dispatch\\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heate\\nTo transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires\\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire\\nOf sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist\\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn\\nMetals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold\\nAs from the Mine.  Mean while at Table _Eve_\\nMinisterd naked, and thir flowing cups\\nWith pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence\\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\\nThen had the Sons of God excuse to have bin\\nEnamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts\\nLove unlibidinous reign’d, nor jealousie\\nWas understood, the injur’d Lovers Hell.\\n\\nThus when with meats & drinks they had suffic’d,\\nNot burd’nd Nature, sudden mind arose\\nIn _Adam_, not to let th’ occasion pass\\nGiven him by this great Conference to know\\nOf things above his World, and of thir being\\nWho dwell in Heav’n, whose excellence he saw\\nTranscend his own so farr, whose radiant forms\\nDivine effulgence, whose high Power so far\\nExceeded human, and his wary speech\\nThus to th’ Empyreal Minister he fram’d.\\n\\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\\nThy favour, in this honour done to man,\\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf’t\\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\\nAt Heav’ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?\\n\\n To whom the winged Hierarch repli’d.\\nO _Adam_, one Almightie is, from whom\\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\\nIf not deprav’d from good, created all\\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\\nIndu’d with various forms, various degrees\\nOf substance, and in things that live, of life;\\nBut more refin’d, more spiritous, and pure,\\nAs neerer to him plac’t or neerer tending\\nEach in thir several active Sphears assignd,\\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\\nProportiond to each kind.  So from the root\\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\\nMore aerie, last the bright consummate floure\\nSpirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit\\nMans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim’d\\nTo vital Spirits aspire, to animal,\\nTo intellectual, give both life and sense,\\nFansie and understanding, whence the soule\\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\\nDiscursive, or Intuitive; discourse\\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you,\\nTo proper substance; time may come when men\\nWith Angels may participate, and find\\nNo inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:\\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\\nYour bodies may at last turn all to Spirit\\nImprov’d by tract of time, and wingd ascend\\nEthereal, as wee, or may at choice\\nHere or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell;\\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\\nUnalterably firm his love entire\\nWhose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy\\nYour fill what happiness this happie state\\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\\n\\nTo whom the Patriarch of mankind repli’d.\\nO favourable spirit, propitious guest,\\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\\nOur knowledge, and the scale of Nature set\\nFrom center to circumference, whereon\\nIn contemplation of created things\\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\\nWhat meant that caution joind, _If ye be found\\nobedient?_ can wee want obedience then\\nTo him, or possibly his love desert\\nWho formd us from the dust, and plac’d us here\\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\\n\\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heav’n and Earth,\\nAttend: That thou art happie, owe to God;\\nThat thou continu’st such, owe to thy self,\\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\\nThis was that caution giv’n thee; be advis’d.\\nGod made thee perfet, not immutable;\\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\\nHe left it in thy power, ordaind thy will\\nBy nature free, not over-rul’d by Fate\\nInextricable, or strict necessity;\\nOur voluntarie service he requires,\\nNot our necessitated, such with him\\nFindes no acceptance, nor can find, for how\\nCan hearts, not free, be tri’d whether they serve\\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\\nBy Destinie, and can no other choose?\\nMy self and all th’ Angelic Host that stand\\nIn sight of God enthron’d, our happie state\\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\\nOn other surety none; freely we serve.\\nBecause wee freely love, as in our will\\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\\nAnd som are fall’n, to disobedience fall’n,\\nAnd so from Heav’n to deepest Hell; O fall\\nFrom what high state of bliss into what woe!\\n\\nTo whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words\\nAttentive, and with more delighted eare\\nDivine instructer, I have heard, then when\\nCherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills\\nAereal Music send: nor knew I not\\nTo be both will and deed created free;\\nYet that we never shall forget to love\\nOur maker, and obey him whose command\\nSingle, is yet so just, my constant thoughts\\nAssur’d me and still assure: though what thou tellst\\nHath past in Heav’n, som doubt within me move,\\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\\nWorthy of Sacred silence to be heard;\\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun\\nHath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins\\nHis other half in the great Zone of Heav’n.\\n\\nThus _Adam_ made request, and _Raphael_\\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\\n\\nHigh matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,\\nSad task and hard, for how shall I relate\\nTo human sense th’ invisible exploits\\nOf warring Spirits; how without remorse\\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\\nAnd perfet while they stood; how last unfould\\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\\nThis is dispenc’t, and what surmounts the reach\\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\\nBy lik’ning spiritual to corporal forms,\\nAs may express them best, though what if Earth\\nBe but the shaddow of Heav’n, and things therein\\nEach to other like, more then on earth is thought?\\n\\nAs yet this world was not, and _Chaos_ wilde\\nReignd where these Heav’ns now rowl, where Earth now rests\\nUpon her Center pois’d, when on a day\\n(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli’d\\nTo motion, measures all things durable\\nBy present, past, and future) on such day\\nAs Heav’ns great Year brings forth, th’ Empyreal Host\\nOf Angels by Imperial summons call’d,\\nInnumerable before th’ Almighties Throne\\nForthwith from all the ends of Heav’n appeerd\\nUnder thir Hierarchs in orders bright\\nTen thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc’d,\\nStandards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare\\nStreame in the Aire, and for distinction serve\\nOf Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;\\nOr in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz’d\\nHoly Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love\\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes\\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\\nOrb within Orb, the Father infinite,\\nBy whom in bliss imbosom’d sat the Son,\\nAmidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop\\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\\n\\nHear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,\\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\\nHear my Decree, which unrevok’t shall stand.\\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\\nMy onely Son, and on this holy Hill\\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\\nAt my right hand; your Head I him appoint;\\nAnd by my Self have sworn to him shall bow\\nAll knees in Heav’n, and shall confess him Lord:\\nUnder his great Vice-gerent Reign abide\\nUnited as one individual Soule\\nFor ever happie: him who disobeyes\\nMee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day\\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place\\nOrdaind without redemption, without end.\\n\\nSo spake th’ Omnipotent, and with his words\\nAll seemd well pleas’d, all seem’d, but were not all.\\nThat day, as other solem dayes, they spent\\nIn song and dance about the sacred Hill,\\nMystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare\\nOf Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles\\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\\nEccentric, intervolv’d, yet regular\\nThen most, when most irregular they seem:\\nAnd in thir motions harmonie Divine\\nSo smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear\\nListens delighted.  Eevning approachd\\n(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,\\nWe ours for change delectable, not need)\\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\\nDesirous, all in Circles as they stood,\\nTables are set, and on a sudden pil’d\\nWith Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:\\nIn Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,\\nFruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav’n.\\nThey eat, they drink, and with refection sweet\\nAre fill’d, before th’ all bounteous King, who showrd\\nWith copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.\\nNow when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal’d\\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light & shade\\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heav’n had changd\\nTo grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there\\nIn darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos’d\\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,\\nWide over all the Plain, and wider farr\\nThen all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,\\n(Such are the Courts of God) Th’ Angelic throng\\nDisperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend\\nBy living Streams among the Trees of Life,\\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reard,\\nCelestial Tabernacles, where they slept\\nFannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course\\nMelodious Hymns about the sovran Throne\\nAlternate all night long: but not so wak’d\\n_Satan_, so call him now, his former name\\nIs heard no more Heav’n; he of the first,\\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,\\nIn favour and praeeminence, yet fraught\\nWith envie against the Son of God, that day\\nHonourd by his great Father, and proclaimd\\n_Messiah_ King anointed, could not beare\\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.\\nDeep malice thence conceiving & disdain,\\nSoon as midnight brought on the duskie houre\\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv’d\\nWith all his Legions to dislodge, and leave\\nUnworshipt, unobey’d the Throne supream\\nContemptuous, and his next subordinate\\nAwak’ning, thus to him in secret spake.\\n\\nSleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close\\nThy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree\\nOf yesterday, so late hath past the lips\\nOf Heav’ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts\\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\\nThy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos’d;\\nNew Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\\nIn us who serve, new Counsels, to debate\\nWhat doubtful may ensue, more in this place\\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\\nOf all those Myriads which we lead the chief;\\nTell them that by command, ere yet dim Night\\nHer shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\\nAnd all who under me thir Banners wave,\\nHomeward with flying march where we possess\\nThe Quarters of the North, there to prepare\\nFit entertainment to receive our King\\nThe great _Messiah_, and his new commands,\\nWho speedily through all the Hierarchies\\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.\\n\\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus’d\\nBad influence into th’ unwarie brest\\nOf his Associate; hee together calls,\\nOr several one by one, the Regent Powers,\\nUnder him Regent, tells, as he was taught,\\nThat the most High commanding, now ere Night,\\nNow ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav’n,\\nThe great Hierarchal Standard was to move;\\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\\nOr taint integritie; but all obey’d\\nThe wonted signal, and superior voice\\nOf thir great Potentate; for great indeed\\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heav’n;\\nHis count’nance, as the Morning Starr that guides\\nThe starrie flock, allur’d them, and with lyes\\nDrew after him the third part of Heav’ns Host:\\nMean while th’ Eternal eye, whose sight discernes\\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount\\nAnd from within the golden Lamps that burne\\nNightly before him, saw without thir light\\nRebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred\\nAmong the sons of Morn, what multitudes\\nWere banded to oppose his high Decree;\\nAnd smiling to his onely Son thus said.\\n\\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\\nNeerly it now concernes us to be sure\\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what Arms\\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\\nOf Deitie or Empire, such a foe\\nIs rising, who intends to erect his Throne\\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious North;\\nNor so content, hath in his thought to trie\\nIn battel, what our Power is, or our right.\\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\\nWith speed what force is left, and all imploy\\nIn our defence, lest unawares we lose\\nThis our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.\\n\\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer\\nLight’ning Divine, ineffable, serene,\\nMade answer.

Whence _Adam_ soon repeal’d\\nThe doubts that in his heart arose: and now\\nLed on, yet sinless, with desire to know\\nWhat neerer might concern him, how this World\\nOf Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,\\nWhen, and whereof created, for what cause,\\nWhat within _Eden_ or without was done\\nBefore his memorie, as one whose drouth\\nYet scarce allay’d still eyes the current streame,\\nWhose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,\\nProceeded thus to ask his Heav’nly Guest.\\n\\nGreat things, and full of wonder in our eares,\\nFarr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d\\nDivine Interpreter, by favour sent\\nDown from the Empyrean to forewarne\\nUs timely of what might else have bin our loss,\\nUnknown, which human knowledg could not reach:\\nFor which to the infinitly Good we owe\\nImmortal thanks, and his admonishment\\nReceave with solemne purpose to observe\\nImmutably his sovran will, the end\\nOf what we are.

That Earth now\\nSeemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,\\nOr wander with delight, and love to haunt\\nHer sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d\\nUpon the Earth, and man to till the ground\\nNone was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist\\nWent up and waterd all the ground, and each\\nPlant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth\\nGod made, and every Herb, before it grew\\nOn the green stemm; God saw that it was good:\\nSo Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.\\n\\nAgain th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights\\nHigh in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide\\nThe Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,\\nFor Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,\\nAnd let them be for Lights as I ordaine\\nThir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n\\nTo give Light on the Earth; and it was so.\\nAnd God made two great Lights, great for thir use\\nTo Man, the greater to have rule by Day,\\nThe less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,\\nAnd set them in the Firmament of Heav’n\\nTo illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day\\nIn thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,\\nAnd Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,\\nSurveying his great Work, that it was good:\\nFor of Celestial Bodies first the Sun\\nA mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,\\nThough of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon\\nGlobose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,\\nAnd sowd with Starrs the Heav’n thick as a field:\\nOf Light by farr the greater part he took,\\nTransplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac’d\\nIn the Suns Orb, made porous to receive\\nAnd drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine\\nHer gather’d beams, great Palace now of Light.\\nHither as to thir Fountain other Starrs\\nRepairing, in thir gold’n Urns draw Light,\\nAnd hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;\\nBy tincture or reflection they augment\\nThir small peculiar, though from human sight\\nSo farr remote, with diminution seen.\\nFirst in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,\\nRegent of Day, and all th’ Horizon round\\nInvested with bright Rayes, jocond to run\\nHis Longitude through Heav’ns high rode: the gray\\nDawn, and the _Pleiades_ before him danc’d\\nShedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,\\nBut opposite in leveld West was set\\nHis mirror, with full face borrowing her Light\\nFrom him, for other light she needed none\\nIn that aspect, and still that distance keepes\\nTill night, then in the East her turn she shines,\\nRevolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign\\nWith thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,\\nWith thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d\\nSpangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd\\nWith thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,\\nGlad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day.\\n\\nAnd God said, let the Waters generate\\nReptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:\\nAnd let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings\\nDisplayd on the op’n Firmament of Heav’n.\\nAnd God created the great Whales, and each\\nSoul living, each that crept, which plenteously\\nThe waters generated by thir kindes,\\nAnd every Bird of wing after his kinde;\\nAnd saw that it was good, and bless’d them, saying,\\nBe fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas\\nAnd Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;\\nAnd let the Fowle be multiply’d on the Earth.\\nForthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay\\nWith Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales\\nOf Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales\\nGlide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft\\nBank the mid Sea: part single or with mate\\nGraze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves\\nOf Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance\\nShow to the Sun thir wav’d coats dropt with Gold,\\nOr in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend\\nMoist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food\\nIn jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,\\nAnd bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk\\nWallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate\\nTempest the Ocean: there Leviathan\\nHugest of living Creatures, on the Deep\\nStretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,\\nAnd seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles\\nDraws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.\\nMean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares\\nThir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon\\nBursting with kindly rupture forth disclos’d\\nThir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge\\nThey summ’d thir Penns, and soaring th’ air sublime\\nWith clang despis’d the ground, under a cloud\\nIn prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork\\nOn Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:\\nPart loosly wing the Region, part more wise\\nIn common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,\\nIntelligent of seasons, and set forth\\nThir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s\\nFlying, and over Lands with mutual wing\\nEasing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane\\nHer annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire\\nFloats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:\\nFrom Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song\\nSolac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings\\nTill Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal\\nCeas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:\\nOthers on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d\\nThir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck\\nBetween her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes\\nHer state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit\\nThe Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre\\nThe mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground\\nWalk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds\\nThe silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine\\nAdorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue\\nOf Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus\\nWith Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,\\nEv’ning and Morn solemniz’d the Fift day.\\n\\nThe Sixt, and of Creation last arose\\nWith Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,\\nLet th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,\\nCattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,\\nEach in their kinde.  The Earth obey’d, and strait\\nOp’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth\\nInnumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,\\nLimb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose\\nAs from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns\\nIn Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;\\nAmong the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:\\nThe Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:\\nThose rare and solitarie, these in flocks\\nPasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:\\nThe grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d\\nThe Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free\\nHis hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,\\nAnd Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,\\nThe Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale\\nRising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw\\nIn Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground\\nBore up his branching head: scarse from his mould\\n_Behemoth_ biggest born of Earth upheav’d\\nHis vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,\\nAs Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land\\nThe River Horse and scalie Crocodile.\\nAt once came forth whatever creeps the ground,\\nInsect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans\\nFor wings, and smallest Lineaments exact\\nIn all the Liveries dect of Summers pride\\nWith spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:\\nThese as a line thir long dimension drew,\\nStreaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all\\nMinims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde\\nWondrous in length and corpulence involv’d\\nThir Snakie foulds, and added wings.

Up he rode\\nFollowd with acclamation and the sound\\nSymphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun’d\\nAngelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire\\nResounded, (thou remember’st, for thou heardst)\\nThe Heav’ns and all the Constellations rung,\\nThe Planets in thir stations list’ning stood,\\nWhile the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.\\nOpen, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,\\nOpen, ye Heav’ns, your living dores; let in\\nThe great Creator from his work returnd\\nMagnificent, his Six days work, a World;\\nOpen, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne\\nTo visit oft the dwellings of just Men\\nDelighted, and with frequent intercourse\\nThither will send his winged Messengers\\nOn errands of supernal Grace.

And now on Earth the Seaventh\\nEev’ning arose in _Eden_, for the Sun\\nWas set, and twilight from the East came on,\\nForerunning Night; when at the holy mount\\nOf Heav’ns high-seated top, th’ Impereal Throne\\nOf Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,\\nThe Filial Power arriv’d, and sate him down\\nWith his great Father (for he also went\\nInvisible, yet staid (such priviledge\\nHath Omnipresence) and the work ordain’d,\\nAuthor and end of all things, and from work\\nNow resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,\\nAs resting on that day from all his work,\\nBut not in silence holy kept; the Harp\\nHad work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,\\nAnd Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,\\nAll sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire\\nTemper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice\\nChoral or Unison: of incense Clouds\\nFuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.\\nCreation and the Six dayes acts they sung,\\nGreat are thy works, _Jehovah_, infinite\\nThy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue\\nRelate thee; greater now in thy return\\nThen from the Giant Angels; thee that day\\nThy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create\\nIs greater then created to destroy.\\nWho can impair thee, mighty King, or bound\\nThy Empire? easily the proud attempt\\nOf Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine\\nThou hast repeld, while impiously they thought\\nThee to diminish, and from thee withdraw\\nThe number of thy worshippers.

Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,\\nAnd thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,\\nYe Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,\\nAnd ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,\\nTell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?\\nNot of my self; by some great Maker then,\\nIn goodness and in power praeeminent;\\nTell me, how may I know him, how adore,\\nFrom whom I have that thus I move and live,\\nAnd feel that I am happier then I know.\\nWhile thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,\\nFrom where I first drew Aire, and first beheld\\nThis happie Light, when answer none return’d,\\nOn a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours\\nPensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep\\nFirst found me, and with soft oppression seis’d\\nMy droused sense, untroubl’d, though I thought\\nI then was passing to my former state\\nInsensible, and forthwith to dissolve:\\nWhen suddenly stood at my Head a dream,\\nWhose inward apparition gently mov’d\\nMy Fancy to believe I yet had being,\\nAnd livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,\\nAnd said, thy Mansion wants thee, _Adam_, rise,\\nFirst Man, of Men innumerable ordain’d\\nFirst Father, call’d by thee I come thy Guide\\nTo the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar’d.\\nSo saying, by the hand he took me rais’d,\\nAnd over Fields and Waters, as in Aire\\nSmooth sliding without step, last led me up\\nA woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,\\nA Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees\\nPlanted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw\\nOf Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree\\nLoad’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye\\nTempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite\\nTo pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found\\nBefore mine Eyes all real, as the dream\\nHad lively shadowd: Here had new begun\\nMy wandring, had not hee who was my Guide\\nUp hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,\\nPresence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw\\nIn adoration at his feet I fell\\nSubmiss: he rear’d me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,\\nSaid mildely, Author of all this thou seest\\nAbove, or round about thee or beneath.\\nThis Paradise I give thee, count it thine\\nTo Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:\\nOf every Tree that in the Garden growes\\nEate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:\\nBut of the Tree whose operation brings\\nKnowledg of good and ill, which I have set\\nThe Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,\\nAmid the Garden by the Tree of Life,\\nRemember what I warne thee, shun to taste,\\nAnd shun the bitter consequence: for know,\\nThe day thou eat’st thereof, my sole command\\nTransgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;\\nFrom that day mortal, and this happie State\\nShalt loose, expell’d from hence into a World\\nOf woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc’d\\nThe rigid interdiction, which resounds\\nYet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice\\nNot to incur; but soon his cleer aspect\\nReturn’d and gratious purpose thus renew’d.\\nNot onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth\\nTo thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords\\nPossess it, and all things that therein live,\\nOr live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.\\nIn signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold\\nAfter thir kindes; I bring them to receave\\nFrom thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie\\nWith low subjection; understand the same\\nOf Fish within thir watry residence,\\nNot hither summond, since they cannot change\\nThir Element to draw the thinner Aire.\\nAs thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold\\nApproaching two and two, These cowring low\\nWith blandishment, each Bird stoop’d on his wing.\\nI nam’d them, as they pass’d, and understood\\nThir Nature, with such knowledg God endu’d\\nMy sudden apprehension: but in these\\nI found not what me thought I wanted still;\\nAnd to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.\\n\\nO by what Name, for thou above all these,\\nAbove mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,\\nSurpassest farr my naming, how may I\\nAdore thee, Author of this Universe,\\nAnd all this good to man, for whose well being\\nSo amply, and with hands so liberal\\nThou hast provided all things: but with mee\\nI see not who partakes.  In solitude\\nWhat happiness, who can enjoy alone,\\nOr all enjoying, what contentment find?\\nThus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,\\nAs with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.\\n\\nWhat call’st thou solitude, is not the Earth\\nWith various living creatures, and the Aire\\nReplenisht, and all these at thy command\\nTo come and play before thee, know’st thou not\\nThir language and thir wayes, they also know,\\nAnd reason not contemptibly; with these\\nFind pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.\\nSo spake the Universal Lord, and seem’d\\nSo ordering.  I with leave of speech implor’d,\\nAnd humble deprecation thus repli’d.\\n\\nLet not my words offend thee, Heav’nly Power,\\nMy Maker, be propitious while I speak.\\nHast thou not made me here thy substitute,\\nAnd these inferiour farr beneath me set?\\nAmong unequals what societie\\nCan sort, what harmonie or true delight?\\nWhich must be mutual, in proportion due\\nGiv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie\\nThe one intense, the other still remiss\\nCannot well suite with either, but soon prove\\nTedious alike: Of fellowship I speak\\nSuch as I seek, fit to participate\\nAll rational delight, wherein the brute\\nCannot be human consort; they rejoyce\\nEach with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;\\nSo fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;\\nMuch less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle\\nSo well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;\\nWors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.\\n\\nWhereto th’ Almighty answer’d, not displeas’d.\\nA nice and suttle happiness I see\\nThou to thy self proposest, in the choice\\nOf thy Associates, _Adam_, and wilt taste\\nNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.\\nWhat thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,\\nSeem I to thee sufficiently possest\\nOf happiness, or not? who am alone\\nFrom all Eternitie, for none I know\\nSecond to mee or like, equal much less.\\nHow have I then with whom to hold converse\\nSave with the Creatures which I made, and those\\nTo me inferiour, infinite descents\\nBeneath what other Creatures are to thee?\\n\\nHe ceas’d, I lowly answer’d.  To attaine\\nThe highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes\\nAll human thoughts come short, Supream of things;\\nThou in thy self art perfet, and in thee\\nIs no deficience found; not so is Man,\\nBut in degree, the cause of his desire\\nBy conversation with his like to help,\\nOr solace his defects.

Of the Fruit\\nOf each Tree in the Garden we may eate,\\nBut of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst\\nThe Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate\\nThereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.\\n\\nShe scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold\\nThe Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love\\nTo Man, and indignation at his wrong,\\nNew part puts on, and as to passion mov’d,\\nFluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act\\nRais’d, as of som great matter to begin.\\nAs when of old som Orator renound\\nIn _Athens_ or free _Rome_, where Eloquence\\nFlourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,\\nStood in himself collected, while each part,\\nMotion, each act won audience ere the tongue,\\nSomtimes in highth began, as no delay\\nOf Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.\\nSo standing, moving, or to highth upgrown\\nThe Tempter all impassiond thus began.\\n\\nO Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,\\nMother of Science, Now I feel thy Power\\nWithin me cleere, not onely to discerne\\nThings in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes\\nOf highest Agents, deemd however wise.\\nQueen of this Universe, doe not believe\\nThose rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:\\nHow should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life\\nTo Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,\\nMee who have touch’d and tasted, yet both live,\\nAnd life more perfet have attaind then Fate\\nMeant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.\\nShall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast\\nIs open? or will God incense his ire\\nFor such a pretty Trespass, and not praise\\nRather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain\\nOf Death denounc’t, whatever thing Death be,\\nDeterrd not from atchieving what might leade\\nTo happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;\\nOf good, how just? of evil, if what is evil\\nBe real, why not known, since easier shunnd?\\nGod therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;\\nNot just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:\\nYour feare it self of Death removes the feare.\\nWhy then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,\\nWhy but to keep ye low and ignorant,\\nHis worshippers; he knows that in the day\\nYe Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,\\nYet are but dim, shall perfetly be then\\nOp’nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,\\nKnowing both Good and Evil as they know.\\nThat ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,\\nInternal Man, is but proportion meet,\\nI of brute human, yee of human Gods.\\nSo ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off\\nHuman, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,\\nThough threat’nd, which no worse then this can bring\\nAnd what are Gods that Man may not become\\nAs they, participating God-like food?\\nThe Gods are first, and that advantage use\\nOn our belief, that all from them proceeds,\\nI question it, for this fair Earth I see,\\nWarm’d by the Sun, producing every kind,\\nThem nothing: If they all things, who enclos’d\\nKnowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,\\nThat whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains\\nWisdom without their leave? and wherein lies\\nTh’ offence, that Man should thus attain to know?\\nWhat can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree\\nImpart against his will if all be his?\\nOr is it envie, and can envie dwell\\nIn heav’nly brests? these, these and many more\\nCauses import your need of this fair Fruit.\\nGoddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.\\n\\nHe ended, and his words replete with guile\\nInto her heart too easie entrance won:\\nFixt on the Fruit she gaz’d, which to behold\\nMight tempt alone, and in her ears the sound\\nYet rung of his perswasive words, impregn’d\\nWith Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;\\nMeanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak’d\\nAn eager appetite, rais’d by the smell\\nSo savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,\\nInclinable now grown to touch or taste,\\nSollicited her longing eye; yet first\\nPausing a while, thus to her self she mus’d.\\n\\nGreat are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,\\nThough kept from Man, & worthy to be admir’d,\\nWhose taste, too long forborn, at first assay\\nGave elocution to the mute, and taught\\nThe Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:\\nThy praise hee also who forbids thy use,\\nConceales not from us, naming thee the Tree\\nOf Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;\\nForbids us then to taste, but his forbidding\\nCommends thee more, while it inferrs the good\\nBy thee communicated, and our want:\\nFor good unknown, sure is not had, or had\\nAnd yet unknown, is as not had at all.\\nIn plain then, what forbids he but to know,\\nForbids us good, forbids us to be wise?\\nSuch prohibitions binde not.  But if Death\\nBind us with after-bands, what profits then\\nOur inward freedom?  In the day we eate\\nOf this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.\\nHow dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,\\nAnd knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,\\nIrrational till then.  For us alone\\nWas death invented? or to us deni’d\\nThis intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?\\nFor Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first\\nHath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy\\nThe good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,\\nFriendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.\\nWhat fear I then, rather what know to feare\\nUnder this ignorance of Good and Evil,\\nOf God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?\\nHere grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,\\nFair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,\\nOf vertue to make wise: what hinders then\\nTo reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?\\n\\nSo saying, her rash hand in evil hour\\nForth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:\\nEarth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat\\nSighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,\\nThat all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk\\nThe guiltie Serpent, and well might, for _Eve_\\nIntent now wholly on her taste, naught else\\nRegarded, such delight till then, as seemd,\\nIn Fruit she never tasted, whether true\\nOr fansied so, through expectation high\\nOf knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.\\nGreedily she ingorg’d without restraint,\\nAnd knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,\\nAnd hight’nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,\\nThus to her self she pleasingly began.\\n\\nO Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\\nIn Paradise, of operation blest\\nTo Sapience, hitherto obscur’d, infam’d,\\nAnd thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\\nCreated; but henceforth my early care,\\nNot without Song, each Morning, and due praise\\nShall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\\nOf thy full branches offer’d free to all;\\nTill dieted by thee I grow mature\\nIn knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\\nThough others envie what they cannot give;\\nFor had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\\nThus grown.

Soon as th’ unwelcome news\\nFrom Earth arriv’d at Heaven Gate, displeas’d\\nAll were who heard, dim sadness did not spare\\nThat time Celestial visages, yet mixt\\nWith pitie, violated not thir bliss.\\nAbout the new-arriv’d, in multitudes\\nTh’ ethereal People ran, to hear and know\\nHow all befell: they towards the Throne Supream\\nAccountable made haste to make appear\\nWith righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,\\nAnd easily approv’d; when the most High\\nEternal Father from his secret Cloud,\\nAmidst in Thunder utter’d thus his voice.\\n\\nAssembl’d Angels, and ye Powers return’d\\nFrom unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,\\nNor troubl’d at these tidings from the Earth,\\nWhich your sincerest care could not prevent,\\nForetold so lately what would come to pass,\\nWhen first this Tempter cross’d the Gulf from Hell.\\nI told ye then he should prevail and speed\\nOn his bad Errand, Man should be seduc’t\\nAnd flatter’d out of all, believing lies\\nAgainst his Maker; no Decree of mine\\nConcurring to necessitate his Fall,\\nOr touch with lightest moment of impulse\\nHis free Will, to her own inclining left\\nIn eevn scale.  But fall’n he is, and now\\nWhat rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass\\nOn his transgression, Death denounc’t that day,\\nWhich he presumes already vain and void,\\nBecause not yet inflicted, as he fear’d,\\nBy some immediate stroak; but soon shall find\\nForbearance no acquittance ere day end.\\nJustice shall not return as bountie scorn’d.\\nBut whom send I to judge them? whom but thee\\nVicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr’d\\nAll Judgement, whether in Heav’n, or Earth; or Hell.\\nEasie it may be seen that I intend\\nMercie collegue with Justice, sending thee\\nMans Friend, his Mediator, his design’d\\nBoth Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,\\nAnd destin’d Man himself to judge Man fall’n.\\n\\nSo spake the Father, and unfoulding bright\\nToward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son\\nBlaz’d forth unclouded Deitie; he full\\nResplendent all his Father manifest\\nExpress’d, and thus divinely answer’d milde.\\n\\nFather Eternal, thine is to decree,\\nMine both in Heav’n and Earth to do thy will\\nSupream, that thou in mee thy Son belov’d\\nMayst ever rest well pleas’d.  I go to judge\\nOn Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,\\nWhoever judg’d, the worst on mee must light,\\nWhen time shall be, for so I undertook\\nBefore thee; and not repenting, this obtaine\\nOf right, that I may mitigate thir doom\\nOn me deriv’d, yet I shall temper so\\nJustice with Mercie, as may illustrate most\\nThem fully satisfied, and thee appease.\\nAttendance none shall need, nor Train, where none\\nAre to behold the Judgement, but the judg’d,\\nThose two; the third best absent is condemn’d,\\nConvict by flight, and Rebel to all Law\\nConviction to the Serpent none belongs.\\n\\nThus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose\\nOf high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,\\nPrincedoms, and Dominations ministrant\\nAccompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence\\n_Eden_ and all the Coast in prospect lay.\\nDown he descended strait; the speed of Gods\\nTime counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing’d.\\nNow was the Sun in Western cadence low\\nFrom Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour\\nTo fan the Earth now wak’d, and usher in\\nThe Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole\\nCame the mild Judge and Intercessor both\\nTo sentence Man: the voice of God they heard\\nNow walking in the Garden, by soft windes\\nBrought to thir Ears, while day declin’d, they heard\\nAnd from his presence hid themselves among\\nThe thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God\\nApproaching, thus to _Adam_ call’d aloud.\\n\\nWhere art thou _Adam_, wont with joy to meet\\nMy coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,\\nNot pleas’d, thus entertaind with solitude,\\nWhere obvious dutie erewhile appear’d unsaught:\\nOr come I less conspicuous, or what change\\nAbsents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.\\nHe came, and with him _Eve_, more loth, though first\\nTo offend, discount’nanc’t both, and discompos’d;\\nLove was not in thir looks, either to God\\nOr to each other, but apparent guilt,\\nAnd shame, and perturbation, and despaire,\\nAnger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.\\nWhence _Adam_ faultring long, thus answer’d brief.\\n\\nI heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice\\nAffraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom\\nThe gracious Judge without revile repli’d.\\n\\nMy voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear’d,\\nBut still rejoyc’t, how is it now become\\nSo dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who\\nHath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree\\nWhereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?\\n\\nTo whom thus _Adam_ sore beset repli’d.\\nO Heav’n! in evil strait this day I stand\\nBefore my Judge, either to undergoe\\nMy self the total Crime, or to accuse\\nMy other self, the partner of my life;\\nWhose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,\\nI should conceal, and not expose to blame\\nBy my complaint; but strict necessitie\\nSubdues me, and calamitous constraint,\\nLeast on my head both sin and punishment,\\nHowever insupportable, be all\\nDevolv’d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou\\nWouldst easily detect what I conceale.\\nThis Woman whom thou mad’st to be my help,\\nAnd gav’st me as thy perfet gift, so good,\\nSo fit, so acceptable, so Divine,\\nThat from her hand I could suspect no ill,\\nAnd what she did, whatever in it self,\\nHer doing seem’d to justifie the deed;\\nShee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.\\n\\nTo whom the sovran Presence thus repli’d.\\nWas shee thy God, that her thou didst obey\\nBefore his voice, or was shee made thy guide,\\nSuperior, or but equal, that to her\\nThou did’st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place\\nWherein God set thee above her made of thee,\\nAnd for thee, whose perfection farr excell’d\\nHers in all real dignitie: Adornd\\nShe was indeed, and lovely to attract\\nThy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts\\nWere such as under Government well seem’d,\\nUnseemly to beare rule, which was thy part\\nAnd person, had’st thou known thy self aright.\\n\\nSo having said, he thus to _Eve_ in few:\\nSay Woman, what is this which thou hast done?\\n\\nTo whom sad _Eve_ with shame nigh overwhelm’d,\\nConfessing soon, yet not before her Judge\\nBold or loquacious, thus abasht repli’d.\\n\\nThe Serpent me beguil’d and I did eate.\\n\\nWhich when the Lord God heard, without delay\\nTo Judgement he proceeded on th’ accus’d\\nSerpent though brute, unable to transferre\\nThe Guilt on him who made him instrument\\nOf mischief, and polluted from the end\\nOf his Creation; justly then accurst,\\nAs vitiated in Nature: more to know\\nConcern’d not Man (since he no further knew)\\nNor alter’d his offence; yet God at last\\nTo Satan first in sin his doom apply’d,\\nThough in mysterious terms, judg’d as then best:\\nAnd on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.\\n\\nBecause thou hast done this, thou art accurst\\nAbove all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;\\nUpon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,\\nAnd dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.\\nBetween Thee and the Woman I will put\\nEnmitie, and between thine and her Seed;\\nHer Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.\\n\\nSo spake this Oracle, then verifi’d\\nWhen _Jesus_ son of _Mary_ second _Eve_,\\nSaw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav’n,\\nPrince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave\\nSpoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht\\nIn open shew, and with ascention bright\\nCaptivity led captive through the Aire,\\nThe Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,\\nWhom he shall tread at last under our feet;\\nEevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,\\nAnd to the Woman thus his Sentence turn’d.\\n\\nThy sorrow I will greatly multiplie\\nBy thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring\\nIn sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will\\nThine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.\\n\\nOn _Adam_ last thus judgement he pronounc’d.\\nBecause thou hast heark’nd to the voice of thy Wife,\\nAnd eaten of the Tree concerning which\\nI charg’d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,\\nCurs’d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow\\nShalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;\\nThornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth\\nUnbid, and thou shalt eate th’ Herb of th’ Field,\\nIn the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,\\nTill thou return unto the ground, for thou\\nOut of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,\\nFor dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.\\n\\n So judg’d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,\\nAnd th’ instant stroke of Death denounc’t that day\\nRemov’d farr off; then pittying how they stood\\nBefore him naked to the aire, that now\\nMust suffer change, disdain’d not to begin\\nThenceforth the forme of servant to assume,\\nAs when he wash’d his servants feet, so now\\nAs Father of his Familie he clad\\nThir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,\\nOr as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;\\nAnd thought not much to cloath his Enemies:\\nNor hee thir outward onely with the Skins\\nOf Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more\\nOpprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,\\nAraying cover’d from his Fathers sight.\\nTo him with swift ascent he up returnd,\\nInto his blissful bosom reassum’d\\nIn glory as of old, to him appeas’d\\nAll, though all-knowing, what had past with Man\\nRecounted, mixing intercession sweet.\\nMeanwhile ere thus was sin’d and judg’d on Earth,\\nWithin the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,\\nIn counterview within the Gates, that now\\nStood open wide, belching outrageous flame\\nFarr into _Chaos_, since the Fiend pass’d through,\\nSin opening, who thus now to Death began.\\n\\nO Son, why sit we here each other viewing\\nIdlely, while Satan our great Author thrives\\nIn other Worlds, and happier Seat provides\\nFor us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be\\nBut that success attends him; if mishap,\\nEre this he had return’d, with fury driv’n\\nBy his Avenger, since no place like this\\nCan fit his punishment, or their revenge.\\nMethinks I feel new strength within me rise,\\nWings growing, and Dominion giv’n me large\\nBeyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,\\nOr sympathie, or som connatural force\\nPowerful at greatest distance to unite\\nWith secret amity things of like kinde\\nBy secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade\\nInseparable must with mee along:\\nFor Death from Sin no power can separate.\\nBut least the difficultie of passing back\\nStay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe\\nImpassable, impervious, let us try\\nAdventrous work, yet to thy power and mine\\nNot unagreeable, to found a path\\nOver this Maine from Hell to that new World\\nWhere Satan now prevailes, a Monument\\nOf merit high to all th’ infernal Host,\\nEasing thir passage hence, for intercourse,\\nOr transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.\\nNor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn\\nBy this new felt attraction and instinct.\\n\\nWhom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.\\nGoe whither Fate and inclination strong\\nLeads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre\\nThe way, thou leading, such a sent I draw\\nOf carnage, prey innumerable, and taste\\nThe savour of Death from all things there that live:\\nNor shall I to the work thou enterprisest\\nBe wanting, but afford thee equal aid.\\n\\nSo saying, with delight he snuff’d the smell\\nOf mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock\\nOf ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,\\nAgainst the day of Battel, to a Field,\\nWhere Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur’d\\nWith sent of living Carcasses design’d\\nFor death, the following day, in bloodie fight.\\nSo sented the grim Feature, and upturn’d\\nHis Nostril wide into the murkie Air,\\nSagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.\\nThen Both from out Hell Gates into the waste\\nWide Anarchie of _Chaos_ damp and dark\\nFlew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)\\nHovering upon the Waters; what they met\\nSolid or slimie, as in raging Sea\\nTost up and down, together crowded drove\\nFrom each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.\\nAs when two Polar Winds blowing adverse\\nUpon the _Cronian_ Sea, together drive\\nMountains of Ice, that stop th’ imagin’d way\\nBeyond _Petsora_ Eastward, to the rich\\n_Cathaian_ Coast.  The aggregated Soyle\\nDeath with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,\\nAs with a Trident smote, and fix’t as firm\\nAs _Delos_ floating once; the rest his look\\nBound with _Gorgonian_ rigor not to move,\\nAnd with _Asphaltic_ slime; broad as the Gate,\\nDeep to the Roots of Hell the gather’d beach\\nThey fasten’d, and the Mole immense wraught on\\nOver the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge\\nOf length prodigious joyning to the Wall\\nImmoveable of this now fenceless world\\nForfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,\\nSmooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.\\nSo, if great things to small may be compar’d,\\n_Xerxes_, the Libertie of _Greece_ to yoke,\\nFrom _Susa_ his _Memnonian_ Palace high\\nCame to the Sea, and over _Hellespont_\\nBridging his way, _Europe_ with _Asia_ joyn’d,\\nAnd scourg’d with many a stroak th’ indignant waves.\\nNow had they brought the work by wondrous Art\\nPontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock\\nOver the vext Abyss, following the track\\nOf _Satan_, to the selfsame place where hee\\nFirst lighted from his Wing, and landed safe\\nFrom out of _Chaos_ to the outside bare\\nOf this round World: with Pinns of Adamant\\nAnd Chains they made all fast, too fast they made\\nAnd durable; and now in little space\\nThe Confines met of Empyrean Heav’n\\nAnd of this World, and on the left hand Hell\\nWith long reach interpos’d; three sev’ral wayes\\nIn sight, to each of these three places led.\\nAnd now thir way to Earth they had descri’d,\\nTo Paradise first tending, when behold\\n_Satan_ in likeness of an Angel bright\\nBetwixt the _Centaure_ and the _Scorpion_ stearing\\nHis _Zenith_, while the Sun in _Aries_ rose:\\nDisguis’d he came, but those his Children dear\\nThir Parent soon discern’d, though in disguise.\\nHee, after _Eve_ seduc’t, unminded slunk\\nInto the Wood fast by, and changing shape\\nTo observe the sequel, saw his guileful act\\nBy _Eve_, though all unweeting, seconded\\nUpon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought\\nVain covertures; but when he saw descend\\nThe Son of God to judge them, terrifi’d\\nHee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun\\nThe present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth\\nMight suddenly inflict; that past, return’d\\nBy Night, and listning where the hapless Paire\\nSate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,\\nThence gatherd his own doom, which understood\\nNot instant, but of future time.  With joy\\nAnd tidings fraught, to Hell he now return’d,\\nAnd at the brink of _Chaos_, neer the foot\\nOf this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop’t\\nMet who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.\\nGreat joy was at thir meeting, and at sight\\nOf that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas’d.\\nLong hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire\\nInchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.\\n\\nO Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,\\nThy Trophies, which thou view’st as not thine own,\\nThou art thir Author and prime Architect:\\nFor I no sooner in my Heart divin’d,\\nMy Heart, which by a secret harmonie\\nStill moves with thine, joyn’d in connexion sweet,\\nThat thou on Earth hadst prosper’d, which thy looks\\nNow also evidence, but straight I felt\\nThough distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt\\nThat I must after thee with this thy Son;\\nSuch fatal consequence unites us three:\\nHell could no longer hold us in her bounds,\\nNor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure\\nDetain from following thy illustrious track.\\nThou hast atchiev’d our libertie, confin’d\\nWithin Hell Gates till now, thou us impow’rd\\nTo fortifie thus farr, and overlay\\nWith this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.\\nThine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won\\nWhat thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain’d\\nWith odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng’d\\nOur foile in Heav’n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,\\nThere didst not; there let him still Victor sway,\\nAs Battel hath adjudg’d, from this new World\\nRetiring, by his own doom alienated,\\nAnd henceforth Monarchie with thee divide\\nOf all things, parted by th’ Empyreal bounds,\\nHis Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,\\nOr trie thee now more dang’rous to his Throne.\\n\\nWhom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.\\nFair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,\\nHigh proof ye now have giv’n to be the Race\\nOf _Satan_ (for I glorie in the name,\\nAntagonist of Heav’ns Almightie King)\\nAmply have merited of me, of all\\nTh’ Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav’ns dore\\nTriumphal with triumphal act have met,\\nMine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm\\nHell and this World, one Realm, one Continent\\nOf easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I\\nDescend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease\\nTo my associate Powers, them to acquaint\\nWith these successes, and with them rejoyce,\\nYou two this way, among those numerous Orbs\\nAll yours, right down to Paradise descend;\\nThere dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth\\nDominion exercise and in the Aire,\\nChiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar’d,\\nHim first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.\\nMy Substitutes I send ye, and Create\\nPlenipotent on Earth, of matchless might\\nIssuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now\\nMy hold of this new Kingdom all depends,\\nThrough Sin to Death expos’d by my exploit.\\nIf your joynt power prevaile, th’ affaires of Hell\\nNo detriment need feare, goe and be strong.\\n\\nSo saying he dismiss’d them, they with speed\\nThir course through thickest Constellations held\\nSpreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,\\nAnd Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips\\nThen sufferd.  Th’ other way _Satan_ went down\\nThe Causey to Hell Gate; on either side\\nDisparted _Chaos_ over built exclaimd,\\nAnd with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,\\nThat scorn’d his indignation: through the Gate,\\nWide open and unguarded, _Satan_ pass’d,\\nAnd all about found desolate; for those\\nAppointed to sit there, had left thir charge,\\nFlown to the upper World; the rest were all\\nFarr to the inland retir’d, about the walls\\nOf _Pandemonium_, Citie and proud seate\\nOf _Lucifer_, so by allusion calld,\\nOf that bright Starr to _Satan_ paragond.\\nThere kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand\\nIn Council sate, sollicitous what chance\\nMight intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee\\nDeparting gave command, and they observ’d.\\nAs when the _Tartar_ from his _Russian_ Foe\\nBy _Astracan_ over the Snowie Plaines\\nRetires, or _Bactrian_ Sophi from the hornes\\nOf _Turkish_ Crescent, leaves all waste beyond\\nThe Realme of _Aladule_, in his retreate\\nTo _Tauris_ or _Casbeen_.  So these the late\\nHeav’n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell\\nMany a dark League, reduc’t in careful Watch\\nRound thir Metropolis, and now expecting\\nEach hour their great adventurer from the search\\nOf Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,\\nIn shew plebeian Angel militant\\nOf lowest order, past; and from the dore\\nOf that _Plutonian_ Hall, invisible\\nAscended his high Throne, which under state\\nOf richest texture spred, at th’ upper end\\nWas plac’t in regal lustre.  Down a while\\nHe sate, and round about him saw unseen:\\nAt last as from a Cloud his fulgent head\\nAnd shape Starr bright appeer’d, or brighter, clad\\nWith what permissive glory since his fall\\nWas left him, or false glitter: All amaz’d\\nAt that so sudden blaze the _Stygian_ throng\\nBent thir aspect, and whom they wish’d beheld,\\nThir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th’ acclaime:\\nForth rush’d in haste the great consulting Peers,\\nRais’d from thir dark _Divan_, and with like joy\\nCongratulant approach’d him, who with hand\\nSilence, and with these words attention won.\\n\\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\\nFor in possession such, not onely of right,\\nI call ye and declare ye now, returnd\\nSuccessful beyond hope, to lead ye forth\\nTriumphant out of this infernal Pit\\nAbominable, accurst, the house of woe,\\nAnd Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,\\nAs Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven\\nLittle inferiour, by my adventure hard\\nWith peril great atchiev’d.  Long were to tell\\nWhat I have don, what sufferd, with what paine\\nVoyag’d the unreal, vast, unbounded deep\\nOf horrible confusion, over which\\nBy Sin and Death a broad way now is pav’d\\nTo expedite your glorious march; but I\\nToild out my uncouth passage, forc’t to ride\\nTh’ untractable Abysse, plung’d in the womb\\nOf unoriginal _Night_ and _Chaos_ wilde,\\nThat jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos’d\\nMy journey strange, with clamorous uproare\\nProtesting Fate supreame; thence how I found\\nThe new created World, which fame in Heav’n\\nLong had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful\\nOf absolute perfection, therein Man\\nPlac’t in a Paradise, by our exile\\nMade happie: Him by fraud I have seduc’d\\nFrom his Creator, and the more to increase\\nYour wonder, with an Apple; he thereat\\nOffended, worth your laughter, hath giv’n up\\nBoth his beloved Man and all his World,\\nTo Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,\\nWithout our hazard, labour or allarme,\\nTo range in, and to dwell, and over Man\\nTo rule, as over all he should have rul’d.\\nTrue is, mee also he hath judg’d, or rather\\nMee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape\\nMan I deceav’d: that which to mee belongs,\\nIs enmity, which he will put between\\nMee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;\\nHis Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:\\nA World who would not purchase with a bruise,\\nOr much more grievous pain?  Ye have th’ account\\nOf my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,\\nBut up and enter now into full bliss.\\n\\nSo having said, a while he stood, expecting\\nThir universal shout and high applause\\nTo fill his eare, when contrary he hears\\nOn all sides, from innumerable tongues\\nA dismal universal hiss, the sound\\nOf public scorn; he wonderd, but not long\\nHad leasure, wondring at himself now more;\\nHis Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,\\nHis Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining\\nEach other, till supplanted down he fell\\nA monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,\\nReluctant, but in vaine, a greater power\\nNow rul’d him, punisht in the shape he sin’d,\\nAccording to his doom: he would have spoke,\\nBut hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue\\nTo forked tongue, for now were all transform’d\\nAlike, to Serpents all as accessories\\nTo his bold Riot: dreadful was the din\\nOf hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now\\nWith complicated monsters, head and taile,\\nScorpion and Asp, and _Amphisbaena_ dire,\\n_Cerastes_ hornd, _Hydrus_, and _Ellops_ drear,\\nAnd _Dipsas_ (Not so thick swarm’d once the Soil\\nBedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle\\n_Ophiusa_) but still greatest hee the midst,\\nNow Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun\\nIngenderd in the _Pythian_ Vale on slime,\\nHuge _Python_, and his Power no less he seem’d\\nAbove the rest still to retain; they all\\nHim follow’d issuing forth to th’ open Field,\\nWhere all yet left of that revolted Rout\\nHeav’n-fall’n, in station stood or just array,\\nSublime with expectation when to see\\nIn Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;\\nThey saw, but other sight instead, a crowd\\nOf ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,\\nAnd horrid sympathie; for what they saw,\\nThey felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,\\nDown fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,\\nAnd the dire hiss renew’d, and the dire form\\nCatcht by Contagion, like in punishment,\\nAs in thir crime.  Thus was th’ applause they meant,\\nTurnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame\\nCast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood\\nA Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,\\nHis will who reigns above, to aggravate\\nThir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that\\nVVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of _Eve_\\nUs’d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange\\nThir earnest eyes they fix’d, imagining\\nFor one forbidden Tree a multitude\\nNow ris’n, to work them furder woe or shame;\\nYet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,\\nThough to delude them sent, could not abstain,\\nBut on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees\\nClimbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks\\nThat curld _Megaera_: greedily they pluck’d\\nThe Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew\\nNeer that bituminous Lake where _Sodom_ flam’d;\\nThis more delusive, not the touch, but taste\\nDeceav’d; they fondly thinking to allay\\nThir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit\\nChewd bitter Ashes, which th’ offended taste\\nVVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,\\nHunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,\\nVVith hatefullest disrelish writh’d thir jaws\\nVVith foot and cinders fill’d; so oft they fell\\nInto the same illusion, not as Man\\nWhom they triumph’d once lapst.  Thus were they plagu’d\\nAnd worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,\\nTill thir lost shape, permitted, they resum’d,\\nYearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo\\nThis annual humbling certain number’d days,\\nTo dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc’t.\\nHowever some tradition they dispers’d\\nAmong the Heathen of thir purchase got,\\nAnd Fabl’d how the Serpent, whom they calld\\n_Ophion_ with _Eurynome_, the wide-\\nEncroaching _Eve_ perhaps, had first the rule\\nOf high _Olympus_, thence by _Saturn_ driv’n\\nAnd _Ops_, ere yet _Dictaean_ _Jove_ was born.\\nMean while in Paradise the hellish pair\\nToo soon arriv’d, _Sin_ there in power before,\\nOnce actual, now in body, and to dwell\\nHabitual habitant; behind her _Death_\\nClose following pace for pace, not mounted yet\\nOn his pale Horse: to whom _Sin_ thus began.\\n\\nSecond of _Satan_ sprung, all conquering Death,\\nWhat thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd\\nWith travail difficult, not better farr\\nThen stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,\\nUnnam’d, undreaded, and thy self half starv’d?\\n\\nWhom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.\\nTo mee, who with eternal Famin pine,\\nAlike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,\\nThere best, where most with ravin I may meet;\\nWhich here, though plenteous, all too little seems\\nTo stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.\\n\\nTo whom th’ incestuous Mother thus repli’d.\\nThou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours\\nFeed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,\\nNo homely morsels, and whatever thing\\nThe Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar’d,\\nTill I in Man residing through the Race,\\nHis thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,\\nAnd season him thy last and sweetest prey.\\n\\nThis said, they both betook them several wayes,\\nBoth to destroy, or unimmortal make\\nAll kinds, and for destruction to mature\\nSooner or later; which th’ Almightie seeing,\\nFrom his transcendent Seat the Saints among,\\nTo those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.\\n\\nSee with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance\\nTo waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I\\nSo fair and good created, and had still\\nKept in that state, had not the folly of Man\\nLet in these wastful Furies, who impute\\nFolly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell\\nAnd his Adherents, that with so much ease\\nI suffer them to enter and possess\\nA place so heav’nly, and conniving seem\\nTo gratifie my scornful Enemies,\\nThat laugh, as if transported with some fit\\nOf Passion, I to them had quitted all,\\nAt random yeilded up to their misrule;\\nAnd know not that I call’d and drew them thither\\nMy Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth\\nWhich mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed\\nOn what was pure, till cramm’d and gorg’d, nigh burst\\nWith suckt and glutted offal, at one fling\\nOf thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,\\nBoth _Sin_, and _Death_, and yawning _Grave_ at last\\nThrough _Chaos_ hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell\\nFor ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.\\nThen Heav’n and Earth renewd shall be made pure\\nTo sanctitie that shall receive no staine:\\nTill then the Curse pronounc’t on both precedes.\\n\\nHee ended, and the heav’nly Audience loud\\nSung _Halleluia_, as the sound of Seas,\\nThrough multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\\nRighteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\\nWho can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\\nDestin’d restorer of Mankind, by whom\\nNew Heav’n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\\nOr down from Heav’n descend.  Such was thir song,\\nWhile the Creator calling forth by name\\nHis mightie Angels gave them several charge,\\nAs sorted best with present things.  The Sun\\nHad first his precept so to move, so shine,\\nAs might affect the Earth with cold and heat\\nScarce tollerable, and from the North to call\\nDecrepit Winter, from the South to bring\\nSolstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\\nHer office they prescrib’d, to th’ other five\\nThir planetarie motions and aspects\\nIn _Sextile_, _Square_, and _Trine_, and _Opposite_,\\nOf noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\\nIn Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\\nThir influence malignant when to showre,\\nWhich of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\\nShould prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\\nThir corners, when with bluster to confound\\nSea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\\nWith terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\\nSome say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\\nThe Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\\nFrom the Suns Axle; they with labour push’d\\nOblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\\nWas bid turn Reines from th’ Equinoctial Rode\\nLike distant breadth to _Taurus_ with the Seav’n\\n_Atlantick_ Sisters, and the _Spartan_ Twins\\nUp to the _Tropic_ Crab; thence down amaine\\nBy _Leo_ and the _Virgin_ and the _Scales_,\\nAs deep as _Capricorne_, to bring in change\\nOf Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\\nPerpetual smil’d on Earth with vernant Flours,\\nEqual in Days and Nights, except to those\\nBeyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\\nHad unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\\nTo recompence his distance, in thir sight\\nHad rounded still th’ _Horizon_, and not known\\nOr East or West, which had forbid the Snow\\nFrom cold _Estotiland_, and South as farr\\nBeneath _Magellan_.  At that tasted Fruit\\nThe Sun, as from _Thyestean_ Banquet, turn’d\\nHis course intended; else how had the World\\nInhabited, though sinless, more then now,\\nAvoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\\nThese changes in the Heav’ns, though slow, produc’d\\nLike change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\\nVapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\\nCorrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\\nOf _Norumbega_, and the _Samoed_ shoar\\nBursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\\nAnd snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\\n_Boreas_ and _Caecias_ and _Argestes_ loud\\nAnd _Thrascias_ rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\\nWith adverse blast up-turns them from the South\\n_Notus_ and _Afer_ black with thundrous Clouds\\nFrom _Serraliona_; thwart of these as fierce\\nForth rush the _Levant_ and the _Ponent_ VVindes\\n_Eurus_ and _Zephir_ with thir lateral noise,\\n_Sirocco_, and _Libecchio_. Thus began\\nOutrage from liveless things; but Discord first\\nDaughter of Sin, among th’ irrational,\\nDeath introduc’d through fierce antipathie:\\nBeast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\\nAnd Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\\nDevourd each other; nor stood much in awe\\nOf Man, but fled him, or with count’nance grim\\nGlar’d on him passing: these were from without\\nThe growing miseries, which _Adam_ saw\\nAlreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\\nTo sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\\nAnd in a troubl’d Sea of passion tost,\\nThus to disburd’n sought with sad complaint.\\n\\nO miserable of happie! is this the end\\nOf this new glorious World, and mee so late\\nThe Glory of that Glory, who now becom\\nAccurst of blessed, hide me from the face\\nOf God, whom to behold was then my highth\\nOf happiness: yet well, if here would end\\nThe miserie, I deserv’d it, and would beare\\nMy own deservings; but this will not serve;\\nAll that I eate or drink, or shall beget,\\nIs propagated curse.  O voice once heard\\nDelightfully, _Encrease and Multiply_,\\nNow death to heare! for what can I encrease\\nOr multiplie, but curses on my head?\\nWho of all Ages to succeed, but feeling\\nThe evil on him brought by me, will curse\\nMy Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,\\nFor this we may thank _Adam_; but his thanks\\nShall be the execration; so besides\\nMine own that bide upon me, all from mee\\nShall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,\\nOn mee as on thir natural center light\\nHeavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes\\nOf Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!\\nDid I request thee, Maker, from my Clay\\nTo mould me Man, did I sollicite thee\\nFrom darkness to promote me, or here place\\nIn this delicious Garden? as my Will\\nConcurd not to my being, it were but right\\nAnd equal to reduce me to my dust,\\nDesirous to resigne, and render back\\nAll I receav’d, unable to performe\\nThy terms too hard, by which I was to hold\\nThe good I sought not.  To the loss of that,\\nSufficient penaltie, why hast thou added\\nThe sense of endless woes? inexplicable\\nThy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,\\nI thus contest; then should have been refusd\\nThose terms whatever, when they were propos’d:\\nThou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,\\nThen cavil the conditions? and though God\\nMade thee without thy leave, what if thy Son\\nProve disobedient, and reprov’d, retort,\\nWherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:\\nWouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee\\nThat proud excuse? yet him not thy election,\\nBut Natural necessity begot.\\nGod made thee of choice his own, and of his own\\nTo serve him, thy reward was of his grace,\\nThy punishment then justly is at his Will.\\nBe it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,\\nThat dust I am, and shall to dust returne:\\nO welcom hour whenever! why delayes\\nHis hand to execute what his Decree\\nFixd on this day? why do I overlive,\\nWhy am I mockt with death, and length’nd out\\nTo deathless pain? how gladly would I meet\\nMortalitie my sentence, and be Earth\\nInsensible, how glad would lay me down\\nAs in my Mothers lap? there I should rest\\nAnd sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more\\nWould Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse\\nTo mee and to my ofspring would torment me\\nWith cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt\\nPursues me still, least all I cannot die,\\nLeast that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man\\nWhich God inspir’d, cannot together perish\\nWith this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,\\nOr in some other dismal place, who knows\\nBut I shall die a living Death?  O thought\\nHorrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath\\nOf Life that sinn’d; what dies but what had life\\nAnd sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.\\nAll of me then shall die: let this appease\\nThe doubt, since humane reach no further knows.\\nFor though the Lord of all be infinite,\\nIs his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,\\nBut mortal doom’d.  How can he exercise\\nWrath without end on Man whom Death must end?\\nCan he make deathless Death? that were to make\\nStrange contradiction, which to God himself\\nImpossible is held, as Argument\\nOf weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,\\nFor angers sake, finite to infinite\\nIn punisht man, to satisfie his rigour\\nSatisfi’d never; that were to extend\\nHis Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,\\nBy which all Causes else according still\\nTo the reception of thir matter act,\\nNot to th’ extent of thir own Spheare.  But say\\nThat Death be not one stroak, as I suppos’d,\\nBereaving sense, but endless miserie\\nFrom this day onward, which I feel begun\\nBoth in me, and without me, and so last\\nTo perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear\\nComes thundring back with dreadful revolution\\nOn my defensless head; both Death and I\\nAm found Eternal, and incorporate both,\\nNor I on my part single, in mee all\\nPosteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie\\nThat I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able\\nTo waste it all my self, and leave ye none!\\nSo disinherited how would ye bless\\nMe now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind\\nFor one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn’d,\\nIf guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,\\nBut all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d,\\nNot to do onely, but to will the same\\nWith me? how can they acquitted stand\\nIn sight of God?  Him after all Disputes\\nForc’t I absolve: all my evasions vain\\nAnd reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still\\nBut to my own conviction: first and last\\nOn mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring\\nOf all corruption, all the blame lights due;\\nSo might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support\\nThat burden heavier then the Earth to bear,\\nThen all the world much heavier, though divided\\nWith that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir’st,\\nAnd what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope\\nOf refuge, and concludes thee miserable\\nBeyond all past example and future,\\nTo _Satan_ onely like both crime and doom.\\nO Conscience, into what Abyss of fears\\nAnd horrors hast thou driv’n me; out of which\\nI find no way, from deep to deeper plung’d!\\n\\nThus _Adam_ to himself lamented loud\\nThrough the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,\\nWholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air\\nAccompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,\\nWhich to his evil Conscience represented\\nAll things with double terror: On the ground\\nOutstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft\\nCurs’d his Creation, Death as oft accus’d\\nOf tardie execution, since denounc’t\\nThe day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,\\nSaid hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke\\nTo end me?

To which our Sire.\\n\\nAlas, both for the deed and for the cause!\\nBut have I now seen Death?  Is this the way\\nI must return to native dust?  O sight\\nOf terrour, foul and ugly to behold,\\nHorrid to think, how horrible to feel!\\n\\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Death thou hast seen\\nIn his first shape on man; but many shapes\\nOf Death, and many are the wayes that lead\\nTo his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\\nMore terrible at th’ entrance then within.\\nSome, as thou saw’st, by violent stroke shall die,\\nBy Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\\nIn Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring\\nDiseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\\nBefore thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\\nWhat miserie th’ inabstinence of _Eve_\\nShall bring on men.  Immediately a place\\nBefore his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\\nA Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\\nNumbers of all diseas’d, all maladies\\nOf gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\\nOf heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\\nConvulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\\nIntestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\\nDropsies, and Asthma’s, and Joint-racking Rheums.\\nDire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\\nTended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\\nAnd over them triumphant Death his Dart\\nShook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok’t\\nWith vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\\nSight so deform what heart of Rock could long\\nDrie-ey’d behold?  _Adam_ could not, but wept,\\nThough not of Woman born; compassion quell’d\\nHis best of Man, and gave him up to tears\\nA space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\\nAnd scarce recovering words his plaint renew’d.\\n\\nO miserable Mankind, to what fall\\nDegraded, to what wretched state reserv’d?\\nBetter end heer unborn.  Why is life giv’n\\nTo be thus wrested from us? rather why\\nObtruded on us thus? who if we knew\\nWhat we receive, would either not accept\\nLife offer’d, or soon beg to lay it down,\\nGlad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus\\nTh’ Image of God in man created once\\nSo goodly and erect, though faultie since,\\nTo such unsightly sufferings be debas’t\\nUnder inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,\\nRetaining still Divine similitude\\nIn part, from such deformities be free,\\nAnd for his Makers Image sake exempt?\\n\\nThir Makers Image, answerd _Michael_, then\\nForsook them, when themselves they villifi’d\\nTo serve ungovern’d appetite, and took\\nHis Image whom they serv’d, a brutish vice,\\nInductive mainly to the sin of _Eve_.\\nTherefore so abject is thir punishment,\\nDisfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,\\nOr if his likeness, by themselves defac’t\\nWhile they pervert pure Natures healthful rules\\nTo loathsom sickness, worthily, since they\\nGods Image did not reverence in themselves.\\n\\nI yeild it just, said _Adam_, and submit.\\nBut is there yet no other way, besides\\nThese painful passages, how we may come\\nTo Death, and mix with our connatural dust?\\n\\nThere is, said _Michael_, if thou well observe\\nThe rule of not too much, by temperance taught\\nIn what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence\\nDue nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\\nTill many years over thy head return:\\nSo maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop\\nInto thy Mothers lap, or be with ease\\nGatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:\\nThis is old age; but then thou must outlive\\nThy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change\\nTo witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then\\nObtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,\\nTo what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth\\nHopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne\\nA melancholly damp of cold and dry\\nTo waigh thy spirits down, and last consume\\nThe Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.\\n\\nHenceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong\\nLife much, bent rather how I may be quit\\nFairest and easiest of this combrous charge,\\nWhich I must keep till my appointed day\\nOf rendring up.  _Michael_ to him repli’d.\\n\\nNor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst\\nLive well, how long or short permit to Heav’n:\\nAnd now prepare thee for another sight.\\n\\nHe lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon\\nWere Tents of various hue; by some were herds\\nOf Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound\\nOf Instruments that made melodious chime\\nWas heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd\\nThir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch\\nInstinct through all proportions low and high\\nFled and pursu’d transverse the resonant fugue.\\nIn other part stood one who at the Forge\\nLabouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass\\nHad melted (whether found where casual fire\\nHad wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,\\nDown to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot\\nTo som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream\\nFrom underground) the liquid Ore he dreind\\nInto fit moulds prepar’d; from which he formd\\nFirst his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought\\nFulfil or grav’n in mettle.  After these,\\nBut on the hether side a different sort\\nFrom the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,\\nDown to the Plain descended: by thir guise\\nJust men they seemd, and all thir study bent\\nTo worship God aright, and know his works\\nNot hid, nor those things lost which might preserve\\nFreedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain\\nLong had not walkt, when from the Tents behold\\nA Beavie of fair Women, richly gay\\nIn Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung\\nSoft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:\\nThe Men though grave, ey’d them, and let thir eyes\\nRove without rein, till in the amorous Net\\nFast caught, they lik’d, and each his liking chose;\\nAnd now of love they treat till th’ Eevning Star\\nLoves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat\\nThey light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke\\nHymen, then first to marriage Rites invok’t;\\nWith Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.\\nSuch happy interview and fair event\\nOf love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,\\nAnd charming Symphonies attach’d the heart\\nOf _Adam_, soon enclin’d to admit delight,\\nThe bent of Nature; which he thus express’d.\\n\\nTrue opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,\\nMuch better seems this Vision, and more hope\\nOf peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;\\nThose were of hate and death, or pain much worse,\\nHere Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.\\n\\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Judg not what is best\\nBy pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\\nCreated, as thou art, to nobler end\\nHolie and pure, conformitie divine.\\nThose Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\\nOf wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\\nWho slew his Brother; studious they appere\\nOf Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\\nUnmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\\nTaught them, but they his gifts acknowledg’d none.\\nYet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\\nFor that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\\nOf Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\\nYet empty of all good wherein consists\\nWomans domestic honour and chief praise;\\nBred onely and completed to the taste\\nOf lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,\\nTo dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\\nTo these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\\nReligious titl’d them the Sons of God,\\nShall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame\\nIgnobly, to the trains and to the smiles\\nOf these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\\n(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which\\nThe world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\\n\\nTo whom thus _Adam_ of short joy bereft.\\nO pittie and shame, that they who to live well\\nEnterd so faire, should turn aside to tread\\nPaths indirect, or in the mid way faint!\\nBut still I see the tenor of Mans woe\\nHolds on the same, from Woman to begin.\\n\\nFrom Mans effeminate slackness it begins,\\nSaid th’ Angel, who should better hold his place\\nBy wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.\\nBut now prepare thee for another Scene.\\n\\nHe lookd and saw wide Territorie spred\\nBefore him, Towns, and rural works between,\\nCities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,\\nConcours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,\\nGiants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;\\nPart wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,\\nSingle or in Array of Battel rang’d\\nBoth Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;\\nOne way a Band select from forage drives\\nA herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine\\nFrom a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,\\nEwes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,\\nThir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,\\nBut call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;\\nWith cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;\\nWhere Cattel pastur’d late, now scatterd lies\\nWith Carcasses and Arms th’ ensanguind Field\\nDeserted: Others to a Citie strong\\nLay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,\\nAssaulting; others from the Wall defend\\nWith Dart and Jav’lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;\\nOn each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.\\nIn other part the scepter’d Haralds call\\nTo Council in the Citie Gates: anon\\nGrey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,\\nAssemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon\\nIn factious opposition, till at last\\nOf middle Age one rising, eminent\\nIn wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,\\nOf Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,\\nAnd Judgement from above: him old and young\\nExploded, and had seiz’d with violent hands,\\nHad not a Cloud descending snatch’d him thence\\nUnseen amid the throng: so violence\\nProceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law\\nThrough all the Plain, and refuge none was found.\\n_Adam_ was all in tears, and to his guide\\nLamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,\\nDeaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death\\nInhumanly to men, and multiply\\nTen thousand fould the sin of him who slew\\nHis Brother; for of whom such massacher\\nMake they but of thir Brethren, men of men?\\nBut who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav’n\\nRescu’d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?\\n\\nTo whom thus _Michael_; These are the product\\nOf those ill-mated Marriages thou saw’st;\\nWhere good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\\nAbhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\\nProduce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\\nSuch were these Giants, men of high renown;\\nFor in those dayes Might onely shall be admir’d,\\nAnd Valour and Heroic Vertu call’d;\\nTo overcome in Battel, and subdue\\nNations, and bring home spoils with infinite\\nMan-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\\nOf human Glorie, and for Glorie done\\nOf triumph, to be styl’d great Conquerours,\\nPatrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\\nDestroyers rightlier call’d and Plagues of men.\\nThus Fame shall be achiev’d, renown on Earth,\\nAnd what most merits fame in silence hid.\\nBut hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\\nThe onely righteous in a World perverse,\\nAnd therefore hated, therefore so beset\\nWith Foes for daring single to be just,\\nAnd utter odious Truth, that God would come\\nTo judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\\nRapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\\nDid, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\\nHigh in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\\nExempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\\nAwaits the good, the rest what punishment;\\nWhich now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\\n\\nHe look’d, & saw the face of things quite chang’d;\\nThe brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,\\nAll now was turn’d to jollitie and game,\\nTo luxurie and riot, feast and dance,\\nMarrying or prostituting, as befell,\\nRape or Adulterie, where passing faire\\nAllurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.\\nAt length a Reverend Sire among them came,\\nAnd of thir doings great dislike declar’d,\\nAnd testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft\\nFrequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,\\nTriumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd\\nConversion and Repentance, as to Souls\\nIn prison under Judgements imminent:\\nBut all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas’d\\nContending, and remov’d his Tents farr off;\\nThen from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,\\nBegan to build a Vessel of huge bulk,\\nMeasur’d by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,\\nSmeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore\\nContriv’d, and of provisions laid in large\\nFor Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!\\nOf everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small\\nCame seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught\\nThir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons\\nWith thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.\\nMeanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings\\nWide hovering, all the Clouds together drove\\nFrom under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie\\nVapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,\\nSent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie\\nLike a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain\\nImpetuous, and continu’d till the Earth\\nNo more was seen;

and in thir Palaces\\nWhere luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d\\nAnd stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,\\nAll left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t.\\nHow didst thou grieve then, _Adam_, to behold\\nThe end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,\\nDepopulation; thee another Floud,\\nOf tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,\\nAnd sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard\\nBy th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,\\nThough comfortless, as when a Father mourns\\nHis Childern, all in view destroyd at once;\\nAnd scarce to th’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.\\n\\nO Visions ill foreseen! better had I\\nLiv’d ignorant of future, so had borne\\nMy part of evil onely, each dayes lot\\nAnough to bear;

Therefore since hee permits\\nWithin himself unworthie Powers to reign\\nOver free Reason, God in Judgement just\\nSubjects him from without to violent Lords;\\nWho oft as undeservedly enthrall\\nHis outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\\nThough to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\\nYet somtimes Nations will decline so low\\nFrom vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\\nBut Justice, and some fatal curse annext\\nDeprives them of thir outward libertie,\\nThir inward lost: Witness th’ irreverent Son\\nOf him who built the Ark, who for the shame\\nDon to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\\n_Servant of Servants_, on his vitious Race.\\nThus will this latter, as the former World,\\nStill tend from bad to worse, till God at last\\nWearied with their iniquities, withdraw\\nHis presence from among them, and avert\\nHis holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\\nTo leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\\nAnd one peculiar Nation to select\\nFrom all the rest, of whom to be invok’d,\\nA Nation from one faithful man to spring:\\nHim on this side _Euphrates_ yet residing,\\nBred up in Idol-worship; O that men\\n(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\\nWhile yet the Patriark liv’d, who scap’d the Flood,\\nAs to forsake the living God, and fall\\nTo-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\\nFor Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\\nTo call by Vision from his Fathers house,\\nHis kindred and false Gods, into a Land\\nWhich he will shew him, and from him will raise\\nA mightie Nation, and upon him showre\\nHis benediction so, that in his Seed\\nAll Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\\nNot knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\\nI see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\\nHe leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\\n_Ur_ of _Chaldaea_, passing now the Ford\\nTo _Haran_, after him a cumbrous Train\\nOf Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\\nNot wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\\nWith God, who call’d him, in a land unknown.\\n_Canaan_ he now attains, I see his Tents\\nPitcht about _Sechem_, and the neighbouring Plaine\\nOf _Moreb_ there by promise he receaves\\nGift to his Progenie of all that Land;\\nFrom _Hamath_ Northward to the Desert South\\n(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam’d)\\nFrom _Hermon_ East to the great Western Sea,\\nMount _Hermon_, yonder Sea, each place behold\\nIn prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\\nMount _Carmel_; here the double-founted stream\\n_Jordan_, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\\nShall dwell to _Senir_, that long ridge of Hills.\\nThis ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\\nShall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\\nIs meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\\nThe Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\\nPlainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,\\nWhom _Faithful Abraham_ due time shall call,\\nA Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\\nLike him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\\nThe Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\\nFrom _Canaan_, to a Land hereafter call’d\\n_Egypt_, divided by the River _Nile_;\\nSee where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\\nInto the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\\nHe comes invited by a yonger Son\\nIn time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\\nRaise him to be the second in that Realme\\nOf _Pharao_: there he dies, and leaves his Race\\nGrowing into a Nation, and now grown\\nSuspected to a sequent King, who seeks\\nTo stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests\\nToo numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\\nInhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\\nTill by two brethren (those two brethren call\\n_Moses_ and _Aaron_) sent from God to claime\\nHis people from enthralment, they return\\nWith glory and spoile back to thir promis’d Land.\\nBut first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\\nTo know thir God, or message to regard,\\nMust be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\\nTo blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\\nFrogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\\nWith loath’d intrusion, and fill all the land;\\nHis Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\\nBotches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\\nAnd all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\\nHaile mixt with fire must rend th’ _Egyptian_ Skie\\nAnd wheel on th’ Earth, devouring where it rouls;\\nWhat it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\\nA darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\\nMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\\nDarkness must overshadow all his bounds,\\nPalpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\\nLast with one midnight stroke all the first-born\\nOf _Egypt_ must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\\nThis River-dragon tam’d at length submits\\nTo let his sojourners depart, and oft\\nHumbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\\nMore hard’nd after thaw, till in his rage\\nPursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\\nSwallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\\nAs on drie land between two christal walls,\\nAw’d by the rod of _Moses_ so to stand\\nDivided, till his rescu’d gain thir shoar:\\nSuch wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\\nThough present in his Angel, who shall goe\\nBefore them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\\nTo guide them in thir journey, and remove\\nBehinde them, while th’ obdurat King pursues:\\nAll night he will pursue, but his approach\\nDarkness defends between till morning Watch;\\nThen through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\\nGod looking forth will trouble all his Host\\nAnd craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\\n_Moses_ once more his potent Rod extends\\nOver the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\\nOn thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\\nAnd overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\\nSafe towards _Canaan_ from the shoar advance\\nThrough the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\\nLeast entring on the _Canaanite_ allarmd\\nWarr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\\nReturn them back to _Egypt_, choosing rather\\nInglorious life with servitude; for life\\nTo noble and ignoble is more sweet\\nUntraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\\nThis also shall they gain by thir delay\\nIn the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\\nThir government, and thir great Senate choose\\nThrough the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\\nGod from the Mount of _Sinai_, whose gray top\\nShall tremble, he descending, will himself\\nIn Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\\nOrdaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\\nTo civil Justice, part religious Rites\\nOf sacrifice, informing them, by types\\nAnd shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\\nThe Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\\nMankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God\\nTo mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\\nThat _Moses_ might report to them his will,\\nAnd terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\\nInstructed that to God is no access\\nWithout Mediator, whose high Office now\\n_Moses_ in figure beares, to introduce\\nOne greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\\nAnd all the Prophets in thir Age the times\\nOf great _Messiah_ shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites\\nEstablisht, such delight hath God in Men\\nObedient to his will, that he voutsafes\\nAmong them to set up his Tabernacle,\\nThe holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\\nBy his prescript a Sanctuary is fram’d\\nOf Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\\nAn Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\\nThe Records of his Cov’nant, over these\\nA Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\\nOf two bright Cherubim, before him burn\\nSeaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\\nThe Heav’nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\\nShall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\\nSave when they journie, and at length they come,\\nConducted by his Angel to the Land\\nPromisd to _Abraham_ and his Seed: the rest\\nWere long to tell, how many Battels fought,\\nHow many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\\nOr how the Sun shall in mid Heav’n stand still\\nA day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\\nMans voice commanding, Sun in _Gibeon_ stand,\\nAnd thou Moon in the vale of _Aialon_,\\nTill _Israel_ overcome; so call the third\\nFrom _Abraham_, Son of _Isaac_, and from him\\nHis whole descent, who thus shall _Canaan_ win.\\n\\nHere _Adam_ interpos’d.  O sent from Heav’n,\\nEnlightner of my darkness, gracious things\\nThou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne\\nJust _Abraham_ and his Seed: now first I finde\\nMine eyes true op’ning, and my heart much eas’d,\\nErwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom\\nOf mee and all Mankind; but now I see\\nHis day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,\\nFavour unmerited by me, who sought\\nForbidd’n knowledge by forbidd’n means.\\nThis yet I apprehend not, why to those\\nAmong whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth\\nSo many and so various Laws are giv’n;\\nSo many Laws argue so many sins\\nAmong them; how can God with such reside?\\n\\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Doubt not but that sin\\nWill reign among them, as of thee begot;\\nAnd therefore was Law given them to evince\\nThir natural pravitie, by stirring up\\nSin against Law to fight; that when they see\\nLaw can discover sin, but not remove,\\nSave by those shadowie expiations weak,\\nThe bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude\\nSome bloud more precious must be paid for Man,\\nJust for unjust, that in such righteousness\\nTo them by Faith imputed, they may finde\\nJustification towards God, and peace\\nOf Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies\\nCannot appease, nor Man the moral part\\nPerform, and not performing cannot live.\\nSo Law appears imperfet, and but giv’n\\nWith purpose to resign them in full time\\nUp to a better Cov’nant, disciplin’d\\nFrom shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,\\nFrom imposition of strict Laws, to free\\nAcceptance of large Grace, from servil fear\\nTo filial, works of Law to works of Faith.\\nAnd therefore shall not _Moses_, though of God\\nHighly belov’d, being but the Minister\\nOf Law, his people into _Canaan_ lead;\\nBut _Joshua_ whom the Gentiles _Jesus_ call,\\nHis Name and Office bearing, who shall quell\\nThe adversarie Serpent, and bring back\\nThrough the worlds wilderness long wanderd man\\nSafe to eternal Paradise of rest.\\nMeanwhile they in thir earthly _Canaan_ plac’t\\nLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins\\nNational interrupt thir public peace,\\nProvoking God to raise them enemies:\\nFrom whom as oft he saves them penitent\\nBy Judges first, then under Kings; of whom\\nThe second, both for pietie renownd\\nAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receive\\nIrrevocable, that his Regal Throne\\nFor ever shall endure; the like shall sing\\nAll Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock\\nOf _David_ (so I name this King) shall rise\\nA Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,\\nForetold to _Abraham_, as in whom shall trust\\nAll Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings\\nThe last, for of his Reign shall be no end.\\nBut first a long succession must ensue,\\nAnd his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam’d,\\nThe clouded Ark of God till then in Tents\\nWandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.\\nSuch follow him, as shall be registerd\\nPart good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,\\nWhose foul Idolatries, and other faults\\nHeapt to the popular summe, will so incense\\nGod, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,\\nThir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark\\nWith all his sacred things, a scorn and prey\\nTo that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw’st\\nLeft in confusion, _Babylon_ thence call’d.\\nThere in captivitie he lets them dwell\\nThe space of seventie years, then brings them back,\\nRemembring mercie, and his Cov’nant sworn\\nTo _David_, stablisht as the dayes of Heav’n.\\nReturnd from _Babylon_ by leave of Kings\\nThir Lords, whom God dispos’d, the house of God\\nThey first re-edifie, and for a while\\nIn mean estate live moderate, till grown\\nIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow;\\nBut first among the Priests dissension springs,\\nMen who attend the Altar, and should most\\nEndeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings\\nUpon the Temple it self: at last they seise\\nThe Scepter, and regard not _Davids_ Sons,\\nThen loose it to a stranger, that the true\\nAnointed King _Messiah_ might be born\\nBarr’d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr\\nUnseen before in Heav’n proclaims him com,\\nAnd guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire\\nHis place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;\\nHis place of birth a solemn Angel tells\\nTo simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;\\nThey gladly thither haste, and by a Quire\\nOf squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.\\nA Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire\\nThe Power of the most High; he shall ascend\\nThe Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign\\nWith earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav’ns.\\n\\nHe ceas’d, discerning _Adam_ with such joy\\nSurcharg’d, as had like grief bin dew’d in tears,\\nWithout the vent of words, which these he breathd.\\n\\nO Prophet of glad tidings, finisher\\nOf utmost hope! now clear I understand\\nWhat oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,\\nWhy our great expectation should be call’d\\nThe seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,\\nHigh in the love of Heav’n, yet from my Loynes\\nThou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son\\nOf God most High; So God with man unites.\\nNeeds must the Serpent now his capital bruise\\nExpect with mortal paine: say where and when\\nThir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.\\n\\nTo whom thus _Michael_.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5.

Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'paradise_lost.txt'})]"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.
